# Task 8: Facility Hierarchy Endpoints - Verification Checklist

## Implementation Checklist

### Route Definitions (facilities.routes.ts)
- [x] Created `getAccessible` route definition
  - [x] Path: `/facilities/accessible`
  - [x] Method: GET
  - [x] Response schema includes: id, name, facilityType, districtId, districtName, parentFacilityId
  - [x] 200 OK response defined
  - [x] 401 Unauthorized response defined
  - [x] Exported `GetAccessibleRoute` type

- [x] Created `getHierarchy` route definition
  - [x] Path: `/facilities/{id}/hierarchy`
  - [x] Method: GET
  - [x] Request params: IdParamsSchema
  - [x] Response schema includes: facility, parentFacility, childFacilities
  - [x] 200 OK response defined
  - [x] 404 Not Found response defined
  - [x] 403 Forbidden response defined
  - [x] 401 Unauthorized response defined
  - [x] Exported `GetHierarchyRoute` type

### Handler Implementation (facilities.handlers.ts)
- [x] Imported route types: `GetAccessibleRoute`, `GetHierarchyRoute`

- [x] Implemented `getAccessible` handler
  - [x] Authenticates user via session
  - [x] Returns 401 if not authenticated
  - [x] Uses `FacilityHierarchyService.getAccessibleFacilityIds()`
  - [x] Queries facilities with district information
  - [x] Filters by accessible facility IDs
  - [x] Orders by district name and facility name
  - [x] Returns array of facilities with all required fields

- [x] Implemented `getHierarchy` handler
  - [x] Authenticates user via session
  - [x] Returns 401 if not authenticated
  - [x] Validates user access via `FacilityHierarchyService.canAccessFacility()`
  - [x] Returns 403 if user cannot access facility
  - [x] Queries facility with district information
  - [x] Returns 404 if facility not found
  - [x] Fetches parent facility if parentFacilityId exists
  - [x] Fetches child facilities filtered by parentFacilityId and districtId
  - [x] Returns complete hierarchy structure

### Router Registration (facilities.index.ts)
- [x] Registered `getAccessible` route with handler
- [x] Registered `getHierarchy` route with handler
- [x] Routes registered in correct order (accessible before getOne, hierarchy after)

### Authorization Implementation
- [x] Both endpoints use `FacilityHierarchyService` for consistent access control
- [x] `getAccessible` uses `getAccessibleFacilityIds()` method
- [x] `getHierarchy` uses `canAccessFacility()` method
- [x] Proper error responses for unauthorized access

### Data Integrity
- [x] District information included via JOIN with districts table
- [x] Parent facility information included when available
- [x] Child facilities filtered by same district (enforces district boundaries)
- [x] All required fields included in responses

### Requirements Coverage
- [x] **Requirement 2.3**: Facility lists respect hierarchy (hospital users get own + children)
- [x] **Requirement 7.4**: Hierarchy visualization available for role assignment

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (Optional - not required by task)
- [ ] Test `getAccessible` with hospital DAF user
- [ ] Test `getAccessible` with health center accountant
- [ ] Test `getAccessible` with admin user
- [ ] Test `getAccessible` with unauthenticated user
- [ ] Test `getHierarchy` with valid facility access
- [ ] Test `getHierarchy` with invalid facility access (403)
- [ ] Test `getHierarchy` with non-existent facility (404)
- [ ] Test `getHierarchy` with unauthenticated user (401)

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Hospital DAF/DG User**:
   - [ ] GET `/facilities/accessible` returns hospital + child health centers
   - [ ] GET `/facilities/{hospital_id}/hierarchy` shows child facilities
   - [ ] GET `/facilities/{child_id}/hierarchy` shows parent hospital

2. **Health Center Accountant**:
   - [ ] GET `/facilities/accessible` returns only own facility
   - [ ] GET `/facilities/{own_id}/hierarchy` shows parent hospital
   - [ ] GET `/facilities/{other_id}/hierarchy` returns 403

3. **Admin User**:
   - [ ] GET `/facilities/accessible` returns all facilities
   - [ ] GET `/facilities/{any_id}/hierarchy` works for any facility

4. **Cross-District Validation**:
   - [ ] Child facilities only include those in same district
   - [ ] Cannot access facilities outside accessible scope

### Integration Points
- [x] Uses existing `FacilityHierarchyService` (Task 1)
- [x] Uses existing authentication middleware
- [x] Uses existing database schema (facilities, districts)
- [x] Compatible with existing facility routes

## Code Quality Checklist
- [x] TypeScript types properly defined
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Consistent error handling
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Clear error messages
- [x] Code follows existing patterns in codebase
- [x] OpenAPI documentation complete

## Deployment Readiness
- [x] No database migrations required
- [x] No environment variables required
- [x] No breaking changes to existing endpoints
- [x] Backward compatible with existing code

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All implementation tasks have been completed. The endpoints are ready for:
1. Manual testing with different user roles
2. Client-side integration
3. Integration testing as part of Task 18
