# Task 5 Verification Checklist

## Implementation Verification

### ✅ Schema Updates
- [x] auth.types.ts - authResponseSchema includes 'daf' and 'dg'
- [x] auth.routes.ts - signUp route includes 'daf' and 'dg'
- [x] admin.types.ts - userSchema includes 'daf' and 'dg'
- [x] admin.routes.ts - createUserAccount route includes 'daf' and 'dg'
- [x] admin.routes.ts - getUsers route filter includes 'daf' and 'dg'
- [x] admin.routes.ts - updateUser route includes 'daf' and 'dg'
- [x] projects.types.ts - userRefSchema includes 'daf' and 'dg'

### ✅ Validation Implementation
- [x] auth.handlers.ts - signUp validates DAF/DG role assignments
- [x] admin.handlers.ts - createUserAccount validates DAF/DG role assignments
- [x] admin.handlers.ts - updateUser validates DAF/DG role assignments

### ✅ Validation Rules
- [x] DAF/DG roles require facilityId
- [x] DAF/DG roles can only be assigned to hospital-type facilities
- [x] Validation uses hierarchy-validation utility
- [x] Proper error handling with descriptive messages

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] No new TypeScript diagnostics errors introduced
- [x] Consistent error handling pattern across all handlers
- [x] Dynamic imports used to avoid circular dependencies
- [x] Validation occurs before user creation/update

## Task Requirements Mapping

### Requirement 1.1-1.5 (Role System Enhancement)
- [x] 1.1: System supports 'daf' and 'dg' role values
- [x] 1.2: DAF/DG roles require facilityId
- [x] 1.3: User-role-facility association stored in database
- [x] 1.4: DAF/DG roles only at hospital facilities
- [x] 1.5: Single user can hold multiple roles (existing functionality)

### Requirement 7.1-7.3 (User Management Integration)
- [x] 7.1: User creation with DAF/DG requires facilityId
- [x] 7.2: User creation with DAF/DG validates hospital facility type
- [x] 7.3: User updates validate facility type constraints

## Sub-tasks Completed

- [x] Update POST /accounts/sign-up handler to validate DAF/DG role assignments
- [x] Add validation that DAF/DG roles require facilityId
- [x] Add validation that DAF/DG roles can only be assigned to hospital-type facilities
- [x] Update auth.routes.ts role enum to include 'daf' and 'dg'
- [x] Update authResponseSchema to include 'daf' and 'dg' in role enum

## Additional Enhancements

Beyond the task requirements, also updated:
- [x] admin.routes.ts - createUserAccount route
- [x] admin.routes.ts - getUsers route filter
- [x] admin.routes.ts - updateUser route
- [x] admin.handlers.ts - createUserAccount handler validation
- [x] admin.handlers.ts - updateUser handler validation
- [x] admin.types.ts - userSchema
- [x] projects.types.ts - userRefSchema

## Testing Scenarios

### Should Succeed ✅
1. Create user with role='daf', facilityId=1 (hospital)
2. Create user with role='dg', facilityId=1 (hospital)
3. Update user from accountant to daf at hospital facility
4. Update user from accountant to dg at hospital facility

### Should Fail ❌
1. Create user with role='daf', facilityId=null
2. Create user with role='dg', facilityId=null
3. Create user with role='daf', facilityId=2 (health_center)
4. Create user with role='dg', facilityId=2 (health_center)
5. Update user from accountant to daf at health center
6. Update user facility from hospital to health center while role is daf
7. Update user facility from hospital to health center while role is dg

## Files Modified

1. apps/server/src/api/routes/accounts/auth.types.ts
2. apps/server/src/api/routes/accounts/auth.routes.ts
3. apps/server/src/api/routes/accounts/auth.handlers.ts
4. apps/server/src/api/routes/admin/admin.types.ts
5. apps/server/src/api/routes/admin/admin.routes.ts
6. apps/server/src/api/routes/admin/admin.handlers.ts
7. apps/server/src/api/routes/projects/projects.types.ts

## Dependencies Verified

- ✅ hierarchy-validation.ts exists and exports validateRoleFacilityConsistency
- ✅ hierarchy.errors.ts exists and exports custom error types
- ✅ Database enum already includes 'daf' and 'dg' roles

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All sub-tasks completed successfully. The implementation:
- Enforces DAF/DG role validation at user creation and update
- Validates that DAF/DG roles require facilityId
- Validates that DAF/DG roles can only be assigned to hospital facilities
- Updates all relevant schema definitions to include 'daf' and 'dg' roles
- Provides descriptive error messages for validation failures
