- [x] Both endpoints filter by appropriate status
  - DAF queue: `pending_daf_approval`
  - DG queue: `approved_by_daf`

- [x] DAF approver details included (DG queue only)

### ✅ Access Control
- [x] Authentication required
- [x] Role verification (DAF/DG)
- [x] Facility hierarchy filtering via `FacilityHierarchyService`
- [x] Returns empty array when no accessible facilities

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] TypeScript types properly defined
- [x] OpenAPI route definitions created
- [x] Routes registered in index file
- [x] Handlers properly exported
- [x] No TypeScript diagnostics
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Logging for debugging

### ✅ Requirements Coverage

- [x] Requirement 6.4: Ordered by date (oldest first)
- [x] Requirement 3.1: Facility hierarchy routing
- [x] Requirement 3.2: District-based approval workflow

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test DAF queue with DAF user
- [ ] Test DG queue with DG user
- [ ] Test role validation (wrong role returns 403)
- [ ] Test pagination (different page sizes)
- [ ] Test empty queue scenario
- [ ] Test with hospital user (sees child facilities)
- [ ] Test with health center user (sees only own facility)
- [ ] Test ordering (oldest first)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with real database data
- [ ] Test facility hierarchy filtering
- [ ] Test cross-district isolation
- [ ] Test with multiple reports in queue
- [ ] Test pagination edge cases

### API Testing
- [ ] Test with Postman/curl
- [ ] Verify response structure
- [ ] Verify status codes
- [ ] Verify error messages
- [ ] Test query parameters

## Deployment Checklist
- [x] Code committed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] API documentation generated
- [ ] Client team notified
- [ ] Staging deployment
- [ ] Production deployment
