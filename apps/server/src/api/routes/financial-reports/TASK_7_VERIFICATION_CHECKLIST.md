# Task 7: Enhance Existing Financial Reports Endpoints - Verification Checklist

## Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Core Requirements

- [x] **GET /financial-reports** filters by `accessibleFacilityIds` from middleware context
- [x] **GET /financial-reports/:id** validates facility access before returning
- [x] **PATCH /financial-reports/:id** validates facility access before updating
- [x] **DELETE /financial-reports/:id** validates facility access before deleting
- [x] Facility hierarchy information added to report responses
- [x] Query filters respect hierarchy boundaries
- [x] Removed dependency on `getUserContext` and `canAccessFacility`
- [x] Updated error messages to reference "hierarchy" instead of "district"

### ✅ Middleware Integration

- [x] Middleware is applied globally in `create-app.ts`
- [x] Handlers use `c.get('accessibleFacilityIds')` from context
- [x] Handlers use `c.get('user')` from context
- [x] Handlers use `c.get('userFacility')` from context

### ✅ Response Enhancements

- [x] Added `facilityHierarchy` object to report responses
- [x] Includes `isAccessible` flag
- [x] Includes `facilityType` (hospital/health_center)
- [x] Includes `parentFacilityId` for health centers
- [x] Includes `districtId` and `districtName`

### ✅ Access Control Logic

- [x] Hospital DAF/DG users can access own facility + child health centers
- [x] Health center users can only access own facility
- [x] Admin users can access all facilities
- [x] Cross-hierarchy access returns 403 Forbidden
- [x] Empty accessible facilities list returns 403 Forbidden

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

#### Test 1: Hospital DAF User - List Reports
```bash
# Login as hospital DAF user
# Expected: Can see reports from own hospital and child health centers
GET /api/financial-reports
```
- [ ] Returns reports from hospital facility
- [ ] Returns reports from child health centers
- [ ] Does not return reports from other districts
- [ ] Each report includes `facilityHierarchy` object

#### Test 2: Health Center Accountant - List Reports
```bash
# Login as health center accountant
# Expected: Can only see reports from own facility
GET /api/financial-reports
```
- [ ] Returns only reports from own health center
- [ ] Does not return reports from parent hospital
- [ ] Does not return reports from sibling health centers
- [ ] Each report includes `facilityHierarchy` object

#### Test 3: Admin User - List Reports
```bash
# Login as admin user
# Expected: Can see all reports
GET /api/financial-reports
```
- [ ] Returns reports from all facilities
- [ ] Each report includes `facilityHierarchy` object

#### Test 4: Cross-Hierarchy Access - Get Report
```bash
# Login as health center accountant
# Try to access report from different facility
GET /api/financial-reports/{id_from_different_facility}
```
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Error message: "Access denied: facility not in your hierarchy"

#### Test 5: Hospital DAF User - Get Child Report
```bash
# Login as hospital DAF user
# Access report from child health center
GET /api/financial-reports/{child_facility_report_id}
```
- [ ] Returns report successfully
- [ ] Includes `facilityHierarchy` object
- [ ] `isAccessible` is true

#### Test 6: Update Report - Access Control
```bash
# Login as health center accountant
# Try to update report from different facility
PATCH /api/financial-reports/{id_from_different_facility}
```
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Error message: "Access denied: facility not in your hierarchy"

#### Test 7: Delete Report - Access Control
```bash
# Login as health center accountant
# Try to delete report from different facility
DELETE /api/financial-reports/{id_from_different_facility}
```
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Error message: "Access denied: facility not in your hierarchy"

#### Test 8: Filter by Specific Facility
```bash
# Login as hospital DAF user
# Filter by child health center
GET /api/financial-reports?facilityId={child_facility_id}
```
- [ ] Returns only reports from specified child facility
- [ ] Does not return reports from other facilities

#### Test 9: Filter by Inaccessible Facility
```bash
# Login as health center accountant
# Try to filter by different facility
GET /api/financial-reports?facilityId={different_facility_id}
```
- [ ] Returns empty list
- [ ] Message: "Access denied: facility not in your hierarchy"

### Automated Testing

#### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `list` handler with different user roles
- [ ] Test `getOne` handler with accessible and inaccessible facilities
- [ ] Test `patch` handler with access control
- [ ] Test `remove` handler with access control
- [ ] Test facility hierarchy information in responses

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete workflow: create → list → get → update → delete
- [ ] Test with hospital DAF user accessing child facilities
- [ ] Test with health center user restricted to own facility
- [ ] Test with admin user accessing all facilities

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 2.1: Facility Hierarchy Access Control
- [x] Hospital DAF/DG users return reports from own facility + child facilities
- [x] Health center users return only reports from own facility
- [x] All returned facilities share same district

### Requirement 2.2: Hospital User Access
- [x] Hospital DAF/DG users can access child health centers
- [x] Access is limited to same district

### Requirement 2.3: Health Center User Access
- [x] Health center users can only access own facility
- [x] Cannot access parent hospital or sibling facilities

### Requirement 2.4: District Boundary Enforcement
- [x] All returned facilities share same district_id
- [x] Cross-district access returns 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 4.1: Data Query Filtering
- [x] All data queries filtered by hierarchy scope
- [x] Uses `accessibleFacilityIds` from middleware

### Requirement 4.2: Hierarchy Validation
- [x] All operations validate facility access
- [x] Validation happens before any data modification

### Requirement 4.3: Authorization Errors
- [x] Failed access returns 403 Forbidden
- [x] Error messages include facility context

## Performance Verification

### Response Times
- [ ] List endpoint responds within 500ms for typical query
- [ ] Get endpoint responds within 200ms
- [ ] Hierarchy information adds minimal overhead (<50ms)

### Database Queries
- [ ] List endpoint uses efficient IN clause for facility filtering
- [ ] No N+1 query issues with facility hierarchy information
- [ ] Proper indexes used for facility filtering

## Security Verification

### Access Control
- [ ] No way to bypass hierarchy validation
- [ ] Middleware context cannot be manipulated by client
- [ ] All endpoints require authentication

### Data Leakage Prevention
- [ ] No facility data exposed outside hierarchy
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Hierarchy information only shows accessible facilities

## Documentation Verification

- [x] Implementation summary document created
- [x] Verification checklist created
- [ ] API documentation updated with hierarchy information
- [ ] Client integration guide updated

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Other Handlers Not Updated**: Workflow handlers, period locks, and version control handlers still use old approach
2. **generateStatement Partial Update**: May need additional updates for complete hierarchy integration
3. **No Caching**: Hierarchy information is computed on every request (acceptable for now)

## Sign-off

- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for deployment

## Notes

- The facility hierarchy middleware is already applied globally, so no additional middleware configuration is needed
- The implementation is backward compatible - existing API clients will continue to work
- The `facilityHierarchy` object is additive and doesn't break existing response structures
