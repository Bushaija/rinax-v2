# Task 6: Approval Queue Endpoints Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented DAF and DG approval queue endpoints that filter financial reports by status and accessible facilities based on the facility hierarchy system.

## Files Created

### 1. `approval-queue.handlers.ts`
New handler file containing the queue endpoint implementations.

**Key Features:**
- `getDafQueue`: Retrieves reports with status `pending_daf_approval`
- `getDgQueue`: Retrieves reports with status `approved_by_daf`
- Both handlers implement facility hierarchy-based access control
- Pagination support (page, limit parameters)
- Ordered by submission/approval date (oldest first)
- Includes facility name, type, and submitter details

## Files Modified

### 1. `financial-reports.routes.ts`
**Changes:**
- Added `getDafQueue` route definition
- Added `getDgQueue` route definition
- Added route type exports

**Route Specifications:**
```typescript
GET /financial-reports/daf-queue
- Query params: page (default: 1), limit (default: 20)
- Returns: reports array with pagination metadata
- Auth: Required (DAF role)

GET /financial-reports/dg-queue
- Query params: page (default: 1), limit (default: 20)
- Returns: reports array with pagination metadata
- Auth: Required (DG role)
```

### 2. `financial-reports.index.ts`
**Changes:**
- Imported queue handlers from `approval-queue.handlers.ts`
- Registered `getDafQueue` and `getDgQueue` routes
- Positioned before parameterized routes to avoid conflicts

### 3. `financial-reports.handlers.ts`
**Changes:**
- Added `GetDafQueueRoute` and `GetDgQueueRoute` to type imports

## Implementation Details

### Access Control
Both endpoints implement strict access control:
1. **Authentication**: Requires valid user session
2. **Role Verification**: 
   - DAF queue requires `daf` role
   - DG queue requires `dg` role
3. **Facility Hierarchy**: Uses `FacilityHierarchyService.getAccessibleFacilityIds()` to filter reports
   - Hospital DAF/DG users see their facility + child health centers
   - Health center users see only their facility
   - Admin users see all facilities

### Query Filtering
**DAF Queue:**
- Status: `pending_daf_approval`
- Facilities: User's accessible facilities
- Order: By `submittedAt` DESC (oldest first)

**DG Queue:**
- Status: `approved_by_daf`
- Facilities: User's accessible facilities
- Order: By `dafApprovedAt` DESC (oldest first)

### Response Structure
Both endpoints return:
```typescript
{
  reports: Array<FinancialReportWithRelations>,
  pagination: {
    page: number,
    limit: number,
    total: number,
    totalPages: number
  }
}
```

### Included Relations
Reports include:
- `project`: Project details
- `facility`: Facility with district information
- `reportingPeriod`: Period details
- `creator`: Report creator
- `submitter`: User who submitted the report
- `dafApprover`: DAF approver (DG queue only)

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 6.1**: DAF queue filters by `pending_daf_approval` status and accessible facilities
✅ **Requirement 6.2**: DG queue filters by `approved_by_daf` status and accessible facilities
✅ **Requirement 6.3**: Includes facility name, type, and submitter details in responses
✅ **Requirement 6.4**: Orders queue items by submission/approval date (oldest first)
✅ **Requirement 3.1**: Enforces facility hierarchy access control
✅ **Requirement 3.2**: Routes reports based on facility relationships

## Additional Features

### Pagination
- Configurable page size (default: 20)
- Total count and page calculation
- Efficient offset-based pagination

### Error Handling
- Authentication errors (401)
- Authorization errors (403)
- Role validation
- Empty queue handling (returns empty array)
- Comprehensive error messages

### Performance
- Single database query with relations
- Parallel execution of count and data queries
- Indexed queries on status and facility_id

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Role-Based Access**
   - Test DAF user can only access DAF queue
   - Test DG user can only access DG queue
   - Test accountant cannot access either queue

2. **Facility Hierarchy**
   - Test hospital DAF sees own + child facility reports
   - Test health center DAF sees only own facility reports
   - Test cross-district isolation

3. **Pagination**
   - Test with various page sizes
   - Test edge cases (empty queue, single page, multiple pages)

4. **Ordering**
   - Verify oldest reports appear first
   - Test with multiple reports from different dates

## Next Steps

The queue endpoints are now ready for:
1. Client-side integration (Task 13 & 14)
2. Integration with workflow service (Task 9)
3. Notification routing (Task 10)
