# Task 7: Enhance Existing Financial Reports Endpoints - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This task enhances the existing financial reports endpoints (GET /financial-reports, GET /financial-reports/:id, PATCH /financial-reports/:id, DELETE /financial-reports/:id) to use the facility hierarchy middleware context for access control and add facility hierarchy information to responses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated GET /financial-reports (list handler)
**File**: `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

**Changes**:
- Replaced `getUserContext()` with middleware context variables (`accessibleFacilityIds`, `user`)
- Updated facility filtering to use `accessibleFacilityIds` from middleware instead of querying by district
- Added facility hierarchy information to each report in the response:
  ```typescript
  facilityHierarchy: {
    isAccessible: boolean,
    facilityType: string,
    parentFacilityId: number | null,
    districtId: number,
    districtName: string
  }
  ```
- Improved error messages to reference "hierarchy" instead of "district"
- Added check for empty accessible facilities list

**Requirements Addressed**: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3

### 2. Updated GET /financial-reports/:id (getOne handler)
**File**: `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

**Changes**:
- Replaced `getUserContext()` and `canAccessFacility()` with middleware context
- Updated facility access validation to use `accessibleFacilityIds.includes()`
- Added facility hierarchy information to response
- Applied same hierarchy info to corrupted snapshot responses
- Improved error handling and logging

**Requirements Addressed**: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3

### 3. Updated PATCH /financial-reports/:id (patch handler)
**File**: `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

**Changes**:
- Replaced `getUserContext()` and `canAccessFacility()` with middleware context
- Updated facility access validation before allowing updates
- Added facility hierarchy information to updated report response
- Fixed user ID type conversion for `updatedBy` field

**Requirements Addressed**: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3

### 4. Updated DELETE /financial-reports/:id (remove handler)
**File**: `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

**Changes**:
- Replaced `getUserContext()` and `canAccessFacility()` with middleware context
- Updated facility access validation before allowing deletion
- Improved error handling and logging

**Requirements Addressed**: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3

### 5. Updated generateStatement handler (partial)
**File**: `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

**Changes**:
- Replaced `getUserContext()` with middleware context for snapshot validation
- Updated facility access validation for report snapshots
- Simplified aggregation level determination to use `accessibleFacilityIds` directly
- Removed dependency on `determineEffectiveFacilityIds` helper function

**Requirements Addressed**: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3

### 6. Removed Unused Imports
**File**: `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

**Removed**:
- `getUserContext` from `@/lib/utils/get-user-facility`
- `canAccessFacility` from `@/lib/utils/get-user-facility`
- `UserContext` type (no longer needed)

## Middleware Integration

The facility hierarchy middleware is already applied globally in `apps/server/src/lib/create-app.ts`:

```typescript
.use("*", getSessionMiddleware)
.use("*", facilityHierarchyMiddleware)
```

This ensures all routes have access to:
- `accessibleFacilityIds`: Array of facility IDs the user can access
- `userFacility`: User's assigned facility ID
- `userRole`: User's role (daf, dg, accountant, admin, etc.)

## Access Control Logic

### Before (District-based):
```typescript
const userContext = await getUserContext(c);
const accessibleFacilities = await db
  .select({ id: facilities.id })
  .from(facilities)
  .where(eq(facilities.districtId, userContext.districtId));
```

### After (Hierarchy-based):
```typescript
const accessibleFacilityIds = c.get('accessibleFacilityIds') || [];
// Facility IDs are pre-computed by middleware based on:
// - Hospital DAF/DG: own facility + child health centers
// - Health center users: only own facility
// - Admin: all facilities
```

## Response Enhancements

All report responses now include facility hierarchy information:

```typescript
{
  ...report,
  facilityHierarchy: {
    isAccessible: true,
    facilityType: "hospital",
    parentFacilityId: null,
    districtId: 11,
    districtName: "Butaro"
  }
}
```

This allows clients to:
- Display facility relationships in the UI
- Show parent-child facility hierarchies
- Indicate which facilities are accessible to the current user
- Display district context for each report

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Access Control Tests**:
   - Hospital DAF user can list reports from own facility and child health centers
   - Health center accountant can only list reports from own facility
   - Admin can list all reports
   - Cross-hierarchy access is blocked (403 Forbidden)

2. **Hierarchy Information Tests**:
   - Verify `facilityHierarchy` object is present in responses
   - Verify `isAccessible` flag is correct
   - Verify parent/child relationships are accurate

3. **Backward Compatibility Tests**:
   - Existing API clients continue to work
   - Report data structure remains unchanged (hierarchy info is additive)

## Known Limitations

1. **Other Handlers Not Updated**: This task focused on the main CRUD endpoints. Other handlers in the file (workflow handlers, period locks, version control) still use the old `getUserContext` approach and will be updated in their respective tasks.

2. **generateStatement Partial Update**: The generateStatement handler was partially updated for snapshot validation but may need additional updates for complete hierarchy integration.

## Requirements Coverage

✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Filter reports by accessibleFacilityIds from hierarchy context
✅ **Requirement 2.2**: Hospital DAF/DG users access own + child facilities
✅ **Requirement 2.3**: Health center users access only own facility  
✅ **Requirement 2.4**: Admin users access all facilities
✅ **Requirement 4.1**: Data queries filtered by hierarchy scope
✅ **Requirement 4.2**: Hierarchy validation on all operations
✅ **Requirement 4.3**: Authorization failures return 403 with context

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining handlers (workflow, period locks, versions) in their respective tasks
2. Add integration tests for hierarchy-based access control
3. Update API documentation to reflect hierarchy information in responses
4. Consider adding hierarchy information to list pagination metadata
