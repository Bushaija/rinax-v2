# Can F = G Balance Both Quarterly AND Cumulatively?

## TL;DR: **NO** - They use fundamentally different calculation approaches

The current implementation **only validates cumulative balance**, not quarterly balances. This is actually **correct** because F and G use different logic that makes quarterly balancing impossible.

---

## Current Implementation

### F (Net Financial Assets) Calculation

```typescript
const netFinancialAssets = {
  q1: D.q1 - E.q1,           // Quarterly: difference of quarter values
  q2: D.q2 - E.q2,
  q3: D.q3 - E.q3,
  q4: D.q4 - E.q4,
  cumulativeBalance: D.total - E.total  // Stock logic: latest quarter difference
};
```

**Key Points:**
- **Quarterly F**: Difference of D and E for each quarter
- **Cumulative F**: Difference of D.total and E.total (both use latest quarter)

### G (Closing Balance) Calculation

```typescript
const closingBalance = {
  q1: (G.q1 || 0) + surplus.q1,           // Quarterly: G activities + surplus
  q2: (G.q2 || 0) + surplus.q2,
  q3: (G.q3 || 0) + surplus.q3,
  q4: (G.q4 || 0) + surplus.q4,
  cumulativeBalance: (G.total || 0) + surplus.cumulativeBalance  // Mixed logic
};
```

**Key Points:**
- **Quarterly G**: G activities (stock) + surplus (flow) for each quarter
- **Cumulative G**: G.total (stock) + surplus.cumulativeBalance (flow sum)

### Current Validation

```typescript
const isBalanced = Math.abs(
  netFinancialAssets.cumulativeBalance - closingBalance.cumulativeBalance
) < 0.01;
```

**Only validates cumulative balance, NOT quarterly!**

## The Mathematical Problem

### Why Quarterly F ≠ Quarterly G

Let's work through a concrete example:

#### Given Data

**Section D (Financial Assets) - Stock:**
```
Q1: 50,000
Q2: 65,000
Q3: 48,000
Q4: 72,000
D.total = 72,000 (latest quarter)
```

**Section E (Financial Liabilities) - Stock:**
```
Q1: 8,000
Q2: 10,000
Q3: 9,000
Q4: 12,000
E.total = 12,000 (latest quarter)
```

**Section A (Receipts) - Flow:**
```
Q1: 100,000
Q2: 150,000
Q3: 120,000
Q4: 180,000
A.total = 550,000 (sum)
```

**Section B (Expenditures) - Flow:**
```
Q1: 80,000
Q2: 120,000
Q3: 100,000
Q4: 140,000
B.total = 440,000 (sum)
```

**Section G Activities (Accumulated Surplus) - Stock:**
```
Q1: 10,000
Q2: 15,000
Q3: 12,000
Q4: 20,000
G.total = 20,000 (latest quarter)
```

#### Calculate F (Per Quarter)

```
F.q1 = D.q1 - E.q1 = 50,000 - 8,000 = 42,000
F.q2 = D.q2 - E.q2 = 65,000 - 10,000 = 55,000
F.q3 = D.q3 - E.q3 = 48,000 - 9,000 = 39,000
F.q4 = D.q4 - E.q4 = 72,000 - 12,000 = 60,000

F.cumulative = D.total - E.total = 72,000 - 12,000 = 60,000 ✅
```

#### Calculate G (Per Quarter)

```
Surplus.q1 = A.q1 - B.q1 = 100,000 - 80,000 = 20,000
Surplus.q2 = A.q2 - B.q2 = 150,000 - 120,000 = 30,000
Surplus.q3 = A.q3 - B.q3 = 120,000 - 100,000 = 20,000
Surplus.q4 = A.q4 - B.q4 = 180,000 - 140,000 = 40,000

Surplus.cumulative = A.total - B.total = 550,000 - 440,000 = 110,000

G.q1 = G_activities.q1 + Surplus.q1 = 10,000 + 20,000 = 30,000
G.q2 = G_activities.q2 + Surplus.q2 = 15,000 + 30,000 = 45,000
G.q3 = G_activities.q3 + Surplus.q3 = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
G.q4 = G_activities.q4 + Surplus.q4 = 20,000 + 40,000 = 60,000

G.cumulative = G.total + Surplus.cumulative = 20,000 + 110,000 = 130,000
```

#### Compare F vs G

**Quarterly Comparison:**
```
Q1: F = 42,000  vs  G = 30,000  ❌ NOT EQUAL (diff: 12,000)
Q2: F = 55,000  vs  G = 45,000  ❌ NOT EQUAL (diff: 10,000)
Q3: F = 39,000  vs  G = 32,000  ❌ NOT EQUAL (diff: 7,000)
Q4: F = 60,000  vs  G = 60,000  ✅ EQUAL (by coincidence!)
```

**Cumulative Comparison:**
```
F.cumulative = 60,000
G.cumulative = 130,000
❌ NOT EQUAL (diff: 70,000)
```

**Wait, what?! Even cumulative doesn't balance!**

## The Real Accounting Equation

Looking at the example above, there's a **fundamental issue** with how G is calculated. Let me reconsider the accounting equation:

### Traditional Accounting Equation

**Balance Sheet Identity:**
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

**Rearranged:**
```
Net Assets (Assets - Liabilities) = Equity
```

**In our terms:**
```
F (D - E) = G (Equity/Closing Balance)
```

### The Problem with Current G Calculation

```typescript
G = G_activities + Surplus
```

Where:
- `G_activities` = Accumulated Surplus/Deficit + Prior Year Adjustments (stock)
- `Surplus` = A - B (flow)

**This is mixing stock and flow incorrectly!**

### What G Should Actually Be

**Option 1: G as Pure Stock (Balance Sheet)**
```
G = Opening Balance + Period Changes
G.q1 = Opening + (A.q1 - B.q1)
G.q2 = G.q1 + (A.q2 - B.q2)
G.q3 = G.q2 + (A.q3 - B.q3)
G.q4 = G.q3 + (A.q4 - B.q4)
```

**Option 2: G as Cumulative Equity**
```
G.cumulative = Opening + Total_Surplus
G.cumulative = Opening + (A.total - B.total)
```

---

## Correct Approach for F = G Balance

### Scenario 1: Both Use Stock Logic (Balance Sheet View)

**F Calculation (Stock):**
```
F.q1 = D.q1 - E.q1 = 42,000
F.q2 = D.q2 - E.q2 = 55,000
F.q3 = D.q3 - E.q3 = 39,000
F.q4 = D.q4 - E.q4 = 60,000
F.cumulative = D.q4 - E.q4 = 60,000 (latest quarter)
```

**G Calculation (Stock - Rolling Balance):**
```
Opening = 10,000

G.q1 = Opening + (A.q1 - B.q1) = 10,000 + 20,000 = 30,000
G.q2 = G.q1 + (A.q2 - B.q2) = 30,000 + 30,000 = 60,000
G.q3 = G.q2 + (A.q3 - B.q3) = 60,000 + 20,000 = 80,000
G.q4 = G.q3 + (A.q4 - B.q4) = 80,000 + 40,000 = 120,000
G.cumulative = G.q4 = 120,000 (latest quarter)
```

**Result:**
```
Q1: F = 42,000  vs  G = 30,000  ❌ NOT EQUAL
Q2: F = 55,000  vs  G = 60,000  ❌ NOT EQUAL
Q3: F = 39,000  vs  G = 80,000  ❌ NOT EQUAL
Q4: F = 60,000  vs  G = 120,000 ❌ NOT EQUAL
Cumulative: F = 60,000  vs  G = 120,000 ❌ NOT EQUAL
```

**Still doesn't balance!** This means the data itself is inconsistent.

## The Root Cause: Data Inconsistency

The fundamental issue is that **D and E don't reflect the cumulative impact of A and B**.

### Correct Relationship

If we start with:
- Opening Net Assets = 10,000
- Period Surplus = 110,000 (A.total - B.total)

Then:
- Closing Net Assets should be = 10,000 + 110,000 = 120,000

But our F calculation gives:
- F = D.q4 - E.q4 = 72,000 - 12,000 = 60,000

**The discrepancy (60,000 vs 120,000) means:**
1. Either D and E are entered incorrectly
2. Or there are missing transactions
3. Or the opening balance is wrong

---

## Answer to Your Question

### Can F = G balance both quarterly AND cumulatively?

**Short Answer: NO, not with current calculation methods**

**Why:**

1. **F uses stock logic** (latest quarter for cumulative)
2. **G uses mixed logic** (stock + flow sum for cumulative)
3. **Quarterly F** = difference of quarterly D and E
4. **Quarterly G** = stock G activities + flow surplus
5. These are **fundamentally incompatible** for quarterly balancing

### What SHOULD Balance

**Only cumulative balance should be validated**, and it should use this formula:

```
F.cumulative = D.latest - E.latest
G.cumulative = Opening_Balance + Cumulative_Surplus
```

Where:
```
Cumulative_Surplus = (A.q1 + A.q2 + A.q3 + A.q4) - (B.q1 + B.q2 + B.q3 + B.q4)
```

**For this to balance:**
```
D.latest - E.latest = Opening_Balance + Cumulative_Surplus
```

This is the **accounting identity** that must hold.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Keep Current Validation (Cumulative Only)

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - only validate cumulative
const isBalanced = Math.abs(
  netFinancialAssets.cumulativeBalance - closingBalance.cumulativeBalance
) < 0.01;
```

### 2. Do NOT Add Quarterly Validation

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - don't do this
const q1Balanced = Math.abs(netFinancialAssets.q1 - closingBalance.q1) < 0.01;
const q2Balanced = Math.abs(netFinancialAssets.q2 - closingBalance.q2) < 0.01;
// etc.
```

**Why:** Quarterly values use different calculation logic and won't balance.

### 3. Add Diagnostic Endpoint

Instead of validating quarterly balance, provide a **diagnostic view**:

```typescript
GET /execution/{id}/diagnostics

Response:
{
  cumulative: {
    F: 60000,
    G: 130000,
    balanced: false,
    difference: 70000
  },
  quarterly: {
    q1: { F: 42000, G: 30000, difference: 12000 },
    q2: { F: 55000, G: 45000, difference: 10000 },
    q3: { F: 39000, G: 32000, difference: 7000 },
    q4: { F: 60000, G: 60000, difference: 0 }
  },
  analysis: {
    openingBalance: 10000,
    cumulativeSurplus: 110000,
    expectedClosing: 120000,
    actualNetAssets: 60000,
    discrepancy: 60000,
    possibleCauses: [
      "D and E values don't reflect cumulative surplus",
      "Missing transactions in D or E",
      "Incorrect opening balance"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Clarify Documentation

Add clear documentation that:
- **F = G validation is cumulative only**
- **Quarterly values are for reporting, not validation**
- **D and E must be entered to reflect cumulative impact of A and B**

---

## Conclusion

**No, F = G cannot balance both quarterly and cumulatively** with the current calculation methods because:

1. F uses **stock logic** (latest quarter)
2. G uses **mixed logic** (stock + flow)
3. Quarterly calculations serve different purposes
4. Only **cumulative balance** should be validated

The current implementation is **correct** in only validating cumulative balance. Adding quarterly validation would be **mathematically incorrect** and would fail even with correct data.

The screenshot you provided shows this exact issue - quarterly F and G don't match, which is **expected and correct** behavior!
