## Usage Examples

### 1. Program Performance Analysis

Monitor execution rates across different health programs:

```http
GET /api/analytics/budget-execution-rates?groupBy=project&fromDate=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&toDate=2025-12-31T23:59:59Z
```

**Use Case:** Compare HIV, TB, and Malaria program execution rates to identify which programs need additional support or resource reallocation.

**Expected Insights:**
- Programs with consistently low execution rates may need capacity building
- High-performing programs can serve as best practice models
- Resource reallocation opportunities between programs

### 2. Facility Performance Comparison

Analyze execution rates by facility:

```http

### 3. Category-wise Spending Analysis

Break down execution by budget categories:

```http
GET /api/analytics/budget-execution-rates?groupBy=category&facilityId=5&reportingPeriodId=2025
```

**Use Case:** Determine if specific spending categories (HR, equipment, travel) are consistently under-executed across facilities.

**Expected Insights:**
- Spending categories with systemic execution issues
- Resource allocation optimization opportunities
- Category-specific process improvements needed

### 4. Quarterly Trend Analysis

Monitor execution trends over time:

```http
GET /api/analytics/budget-execution-rates?groupBy=quarter&projectId=2

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- **Query Results:** Cache execution rate calculations for 1 hour
- **Aggregations:** Pre-compute common groupings during off-peak hours
- **Trending Data:** Update trend indicators once daily

### Data Freshness
- **Real-time Updates:** Not available due to calculation complexity
- **Batch Updates:** Data refreshed every 4 hours during business hours
- **Manual Refresh:** Available via admin interface for urgent needs

### Response Time Optimization
- **Large Datasets:** Implement pagination for breakdown arrays exceeding 100 items
- **Complex Queries:** Provide estimated response time in headers
- **Timeout Handling:** Maximum query execution time of 30 seconds
