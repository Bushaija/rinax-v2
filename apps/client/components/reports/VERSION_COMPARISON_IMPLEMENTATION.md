- Arrow icon between selectors for visual clarity

### Summary Card
- Total differences count
- Significant changes count (>5% threshold)
- Visual badges showing version numbers being compared

### Differences Table
- Line name and field columns
- Values from both versions (formatted as currency)
- Absolute difference with color coding:
  - Green for increases (with up arrow icon)
  - Red for decreases (with down arrow icon)
- Percentage change with bold highlighting for significant changes (>5%)

### Export Functionality
- Export button to download comparison as CSV
- Includes all difference data
- Filename format: `version-comparison-{v1}-vs-{v2}.csv`

### User Experience
- Loading skeletons while data is fetching
- Empty state when no versions are selected
- Message when no differences are found
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Dark mode support

## API Requirements

The component expects these endpoints to be implemented on the server:

### GET /financial-reports/:id/versions
```typescript
Response: {
  reportId: number;
  currentVersion: string;
  versions: Array<{
    versionNumber: string;
    snapshotTimestamp: string;
    createdBy: string;
    changesSummary: string;
  }>;
}
```

### POST /financial-reports/:id/versions/compare
```typescript
Request: {
  version1: string;
  version2: string;
}

Response: {
  version1: string;
  version2: string;
  differences: Array<{
    lineCode: string;
    lineName: string;
    field: string;
    version1Value: number;
    version2Value: number;
    difference: number;
    percentageChange: number;
  }>;
  summary: {
    totalDifferences: number;
    significantChanges: number;
  };
}
```

## Requirements Addressed

- **8.1**: Display version history list ✅
  - Version selectors show all available versions with timestamps

- **8.2**: Show side-by-side comparison ✅
  - Table displays values from both versions in adjacent columns

- **8.3**: Highlight differences in amounts, line items, and totals ✅
  - Color-coded differences with trend indicators
  - Bold text for significant changes (>5%)

- **8.4**: Display timestamp and submitter for each version ✅
  - Version selectors show timestamps
  - Version metadata includes creator information

- **8.5**: Allow users to download comparison report ✅
  - Export button generates CSV file with all differences

## Integration Example

```tsx
import { VersionComparison } from "@/components/reports/version-comparison";

function ReportPage({ reportId }: { reportId: number }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Financial Report Comparison</h1>
      <VersionComparison reportId={reportId} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

To complete the version control feature, the following tasks should be implemented:

1. **Task 4**: Implement Version Service (backend)
2. **Task 9**: Implement Version Control API Endpoints (backend)
3. **Task 15**: Create Version History Component (frontend)

Once these are complete, the full version control workflow will be functional.

## Testing Notes

- Component tests are included but may require vitest setup for the client
- Manual testing should verify:
  - Version selection updates comparison
  - Export generates correct CSV format
  - Color coding and highlighting work correctly
  - Responsive design on different screen sizes
  - Dark mode styling

## Dependencies

- React Query (@tanstack/react-query)
- shadcn/ui components (Badge, Button, Card, Select, Table, Skeleton)
- Lucide React icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- formatCurrency utility from @/lib/planning/formatters

## Notes

- Currency values are formatted in RWF (Rwandan Franc)
- Percentage changes are displayed with 2 decimal places
- Significant changes threshold is set at 5%
- Export functionality works entirely client-side
- Component handles loading and error states gracefully
