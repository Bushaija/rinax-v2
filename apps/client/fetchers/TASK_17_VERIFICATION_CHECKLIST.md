  - [x] Best practices
  - [x] Testing guidelines
  - [x] Migration notes

### 7. Code Quality ✅

- [x] No TypeScript diagnostics
- [x] Consistent JSDoc format
- [x] Proper requirement references
- [x] Type-safe implementations
- [x] Consistent error handling patterns

## Testing Verification

### Manual Testing Checklist

Test each method with different user roles:

#### Facility Methods
- [ ] Test `getAccessibleFacilities()` as hospital DAF user
- [ ] Test `getAccessibleFacilities()` as health center accountant
- [ ] Test `getAccessibleFacilities()` as admin user
- [ ] Test `getFacilityHierarchy()` for hospital facility
- [ ] Test `getFacilityHierarchy()` for health center facility

#### Queue Methods
- [ ] Test `getDafQueue()` as hospital DAF user
- [ ] Test `getDafQueue()` with pagination
- [ ] Test `getDgQueue()` as hospital DG user
- [ ] Test `getDgQueue()` with pagination

#### Financial Reports Methods
- [ ] Test `getFinancialReports()` filters by hierarchy
- [ ] Test `getFinancialReportById()` validates access
- [ ] Test `updateFinancialReport()` validates permissions
- [ ] Test `deleteFinancialReport()` validates permissions

#### Approval Methods
- [ ] Test `submitForApproval()` routes to correct DAF users
- [ ] Test `dafApprove()` validates DAF permissions
- [ ] Test `dgApprove()` validates DG permissions
- [ ] Test `dafReject()` routes back to accountant
- [ ] Test `dgReject()` routes back to accountant

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Test 403 error when accessing cross-district facility
- [ ] Test 403 error when approving without permission
- [ ] Test 404 error for non-existent report
- [ ] Test network error handling

## Integration Verification

### With React Query Hooks
- [x] Methods work with `useGetAccessibleFacilities()`
- [x] Methods work with `useGetFacilityHierarchy()`
- [x] Methods work with `useGetDafQueue()`
- [x] Methods work with `useGetDgQueue()`
- [x] Methods work with `useHierarchyContext()`

### With Server-Side Middleware
- [x] Methods rely on `facilityHierarchyMiddleware`
- [x] Methods document server-side filtering
- [x] Methods handle middleware-injected context

### With UI Components
- [x] Methods used in DAF queue page (Task 13)
- [x] Methods used in DG queue page (Task 14)
- [x] Methods used in facility hierarchy displays (Task 16)
- [x] Methods used in hierarchy context hook (Task 12)

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 6.1 ✅
DAF users can request their approval queue
- Implemented via `getDafQueue()`

### Requirement 6.2 ✅
DG users can request their approval queue
- Implemented via `getDgQueue()`

### Requirement 2.3 ✅
Users can request facility lists and hierarchy information
- Implemented via `getAccessibleFacilities()` and `getFacilityHierarchy()`

## Documentation Verification

- [x] All methods document hierarchy behavior
- [x] All methods document error conditions
- [x] Comprehensive guide created
- [x] Usage examples provided
- [x] Best practices documented
