## Testing Verification

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Import the hook**
   ```tsx
   import { useHierarchyContext } from "@/hooks/use-hierarchy-context";
   ```

2. **Use in a component**
   ```tsx
   const { accessibleFacilities, isHospitalUser, canApprove } = useHierarchyContext();
   ```

3. **Verify data loading**
   - Check isLoading state during initial load
   - Verify data populates after load

4. **Test role detection**
   - Login as different roles (accountant, daf, dg, admin)
   - Verify canApprove is true for daf/dg, false for others
   - Verify userRole matches session role

5. **Test facility access**
   - Login as hospital user
   - Verify isHospitalUser is true
   - Verify accessibleFacilities includes child facilities
   - Login as health center user
   - Verify isHospitalUser is false
   - Verify accessibleFacilities includes only own facility

6. **Test utility functions**
   - Use canAccessFacility() with various facility IDs
   - Verify it returns true for accessible facilities
   - Verify it returns false for inaccessible facilities

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Test with DAF user at hospital
- [ ] Test with DG user at hospital
- [ ] Test with accountant at health center
- [ ] Test with admin user
- [ ] Test with unauthenticated user
- [ ] Test caching behavior (data persists for 5 minutes)
- [ ] Test error handling (network failure)
