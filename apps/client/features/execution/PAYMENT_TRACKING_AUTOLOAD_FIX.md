# Payment Tracking - AutoLoad Component Fix

## Issue Discovered
The payment tracking logic was only added to `EnhancedExecutionForm` but NOT to `EnhancedExecutionFormAutoLoad`, which is the component actually used for creating new executions.

## Root Cause
There are TWO execution form components:

1. **EnhancedExecutionForm** (`enhanced-execution-form.tsx`)
   - Used for editing existing executions
   - Used in details/view mode
   - ‚úÖ Had payment tracking logic added

2. **EnhancedExecutionFormAutoLoad** (`enhanced-execution-form-auto-load.tsx`)
   - Used for creating NEW executions
   - Has auto-load logic for existing data
   - ‚ùå Did NOT have payment tracking logic

When you create a new execution, the system uses `EnhancedExecutionFormAutoLoad`, which is why the payment tracking wasn't working!

## Solution
Added the complete payment tracking logic to `EnhancedExecutionFormAutoLoad`:

### 1. Added Import
```typescript
import { useExpenseCalculations } from "@/features/execution/hooks/use-expense-calculations";
```

### 2. Added Opening Balance Calculation
```typescript
const openingBalanceCode = useMemo(() => {
  const projectPrefix = projectType.toUpperCase();
  const facilityPrefix = facilityType === 'health_center' ? 'HEALTH_CENTER' : 'HOSPITAL';
  return `${projectPrefix}_EXEC_${facilityPrefix}_A_2`;
}, [projectType, facilityType]);

const openingBalance = useMemo(() => {
  const quarterKey = quarter.toLowerCase() as 'q1' | 'q2' | 'q3' | 'q4';
  const value = Number(form.formData[openingBalanceCode]?.[quarterKey]) || 0;
  return value;
}, [form.formData, openingBalanceCode, quarter]);
```

### 3. Added Expense Calculations Hook
```typescript
const { cashAtBank, payables, totalPaid, totalUnpaid } = useExpenseCalculations({
  formData: form.formData,
  openingBalance,
  activities: form.activities,
  quarter,
});
```

### 4. Added Auto-Update Logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!form.activities) return;

  // Update Cash at Bank (D-1)
  const cashAtBankCode = `${projectPrefix}_EXEC_${facilityPrefix}_D_1`;
  const quarterKey = quarter.toLowerCase() as 'q1' | 'q2' | 'q3' | 'q4';
  const currentCashValue = form.formData[cashAtBankCode]?.[quarterKey];
  
  if (currentCashValue !== cashAtBank) {
    form.onFieldChange(cashAtBankCode, cashAtBank);
  }

  // Update all payable category fields
  Object.entries(payables).forEach(([payableCode, amount]) => {
    const currentPayableValue = form.formData[payableCode]?.[quarterKey];
    if (currentPayableValue !== amount) {
      form.onFieldChange(payableCode, amount);
    }
  });
}, [cashAtBank, payables, form.activities, projectType, facilityType, quarter]);
```

### 5. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive console logging to track:
- Component rendering
- Opening balance detection
- Calculation results
- Field updates

## Testing

Now when you:
1. **Create a new execution** (using `/dashboard/execution/new`)
2. **Enter opening balance** (85,000 in Section A-2)
3. **Check the console** - You should see:
   ```
   ================================================================================
   üöÄ PAYMENT TRACKING: EnhancedExecutionFormAutoLoad RENDERING
   ================================================================================
   üìä [AutoLoad] Form initialized: { formDataKeysCount: 50, activitiesAvailable: true }
   üîç [AutoLoad - Opening Balance] Debug: { openingBalanceCode: "...", extractedValue: 85000 }
   üí∞ [AutoLoad - Payment Tracking] Calculations: { cashAtBank: 85000, totalPaid: 0, ... }
   üí∞ [AutoLoad] Updating Cash at Bank: { willUpdate: true }
   üîÑ [AutoLoad] Calling onFieldChange for Cash at Bank
   ```

4. **Check Section D** - Cash at Bank should now display 85,000

## Files Modified

1. `apps/client/features/execution/components/v2/enhanced-execution-form-auto-load.tsx`
   - Added payment tracking import
   - Added opening balance calculation
   - Added expense calculations hook
   - Added auto-update logic
   - Added debug logging

## Why This Happened

The payment tracking feature was initially implemented only in `EnhancedExecutionForm`, but the codebase has two separate form components:
- One for creating (AutoLoad)
- One for editing/viewing (regular)

The AutoLoad component has additional logic for checking and loading existing executions, so it's a separate implementation.

## Next Steps

1. **Test in browser** - Create a new execution and verify logs appear
2. **Verify calculations** - Check that Cash at Bank displays correctly
3. **Test payment tracking** - Add expenses and change payment status
4. **Consider refactoring** - Both components have duplicate logic now. Consider extracting payment tracking into a shared hook or component.

**Fix Applied**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Testing  
**Priority**: HIGH - This was blocking all payment tracking functionality for new executions
