## Cross-Program Testing

### ✅ HIV Program
- **Hospital**: All features working correctly
- **Health Center**: All features working correctly
- **Test Coverage**: Complete flow, calculations, save/load

### ✅ Malaria Program
- **Hospital**: All features working correctly
- **Health Center**: All features working correctly
- **Test Coverage**: Complete flow, calculations, save/load

### ✅ TB Program

- **Health Center**: N/A (TB only supports hospitals)
- **Test Coverage**: Complete flow, calculations, save/load

---

## Backward Compatibility

### ✅ Verified Scenarios
1. **Loading old records without payment data**
   - Records load successfully
   - Default to "unpaid" status
   - Cash at Bank shows opening balance
   - Payables show total expenses

2. **Editing old records**
   - Can add payment tracking to existing records
   - Changes save correctly
   - Calculations update properly

3. **Data structure compatibility**
   - New fields are optional
   - Existing fields unchanged
   - No breaking changes to API

---

## Edge Cases Tested

### ✅ All Edge Cases Passed
1. **Zero amounts**: Handled correctly
2. **Negative cash at bank**: Calculated correctly (overspending scenario)
3. **Empty form data**: Returns zero values appropriately
4. **Multiple expenses in same category**: All calculated independently
5. **Missing payment fields**: Defaults applied correctly
6. **Invalid partial payments**: Validation prevents submission
