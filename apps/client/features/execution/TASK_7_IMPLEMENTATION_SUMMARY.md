# Task 7: Update Save and Load Logic - Implementation Summary

## Task Details
- **Task**: 7. Update save and load logic
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Requirements**: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5

## Implementation Overview

This task ensures that payment status and amount paid are properly saved and loaded for execution forms, with full backward compatibility for existing records.

## Files Modified

### 1. Enhanced Execution Form Components (3 files)

#### `apps/client/features/execution/components/v2/enhanced-execution-form.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Updated `buildSubmissionActivities()` function to include payment tracking fields
- Added `paymentStatus` (default: "unpaid") and `amountPaid` (default: 0) to activity payload

**Code:**
```typescript
function buildSubmissionActivities() {
  const entries = Object.entries(form.formData || {});
  return entries
    .map(([code, v]: any) => ({
      code,
      q1: Number(v?.q1) || 0,
      q2: Number(v?.q2) || 0,
      q3: Number(v?.q3) || 0,
      q4: Number(v?.q4) || 0,
      comment: typeof v?.comment === "string" ? v.comment : "",
      // Include payment tracking data
      paymentStatus: v?.paymentStatus || "unpaid",
      amountPaid: Number(v?.amountPaid) || 0,
    }))
    .filter(a => (a.q1 + a.q2 + a.q3 + a.q4) !== 0 || (a.comment ?? "").trim().length > 0);
}
```

#### `apps/client/features/execution/components/v2/enhanced-execution-form-auto-load.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Updated `buildSubmissionActivities()` function (same as above)
- Updated data transformation logic to restore payment data when loading existing executions

**Code:**
```typescript
Object.entries(activities).forEach(([code, activityData]) => {
  if (activityData && typeof activityData === 'object') {
    const activityObj = activityData as any;
    const activityCode = activityObj.code || code;
    
    transformedData[activityCode] = {
      q1: Number(activityObj.q1 || 0),
      q2: Number(activityObj.q2 || 0),
      q3: Number(activityObj.q3 || 0),
      q4: Number(activityObj.q4 || 0),
      comment: String(activityObj.comment || ""),
      // Restore payment tracking data with backward compatibility defaults
      paymentStatus: activityObj.paymentStatus || "unpaid",
      amountPaid: Number(activityObj.amountPaid) || 0,
    };
  }
});
```

#### `apps/client/features/execution/components/v2/enhanced-execution-form-updated.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Updated `buildSubmissionActivities()` function (same as above)

### 2. Smart Execution Submission Hook

#### `apps/client/hooks/mutations/executions/use-smart-execution-submission.ts`
**Changes:**
- Updated TypeScript interface to include optional payment fields
- Updated merge logic to preserve payment data when updating existing executions

**Interface Update:**
```typescript
interface SmartExecutionSubmissionParams {
  projectId: number;
  facilityId: number;
  reportingPeriodId: number;
  schemaId: number;
  formData: {
    activities: Array<{
      code: string;
      q1: number;
      q2: number;
      q3: number;
      q4: number;
      comment: string;
      paymentStatus?: "paid" | "unpaid" | "partial";  // NEW
      amountPaid?: number;                              // NEW
    }>;
    quarter: "Q1" | "Q2" | "Q3" | "Q4";
  };
  // ... metadata
}
```

**Merge Logic Update:**
```typescript
// Always update payment tracking data if provided
if ((newActivity as any).paymentStatus !== undefined) {
  mergedActivity.paymentStatus = (newActivity as any).paymentStatus;
}
if ((newActivity as any).amountPaid !== undefined) {
  mergedActivity.amountPaid = (newActivity as any).amountPaid;
}
```

### 3. Execution Submission Handler

#### `apps/client/hooks/use-execution-submission-handler.ts`
**Changes:**
- Updated `SubmissionData` interface to include optional payment fields

**Interface Update:**
```typescript
interface SubmissionData {
  projectId: number;
  facilityId: number;
  reportingPeriodId: number;
  facilityName: string;
  activities: Array<{
    code: string;
    q1: number;
    q2: number;
    q3: number;
    q4: number;
    comment: string;
    paymentStatus?: "paid" | "unpaid" | "partial";  // NEW
    amountPaid?: number;                              // NEW
  }>;
  programName?: string;
}
```

## Requirements Coverage

### ✅ Requirement 5.1: Save payment status and amount paid
**Implementation:**
- `buildSubmissionActivities()` includes `paymentStatus` and `amountPaid` in payload
- Fields are included for every activity in the submission

**Verification:**
- Check network tab during save to see payment fields in request body
- Verify database contains payment data after save

### ✅ Requirement 5.2: Save computed Cash at Bank and payables
**Implementation:**
- Computed values are automatically saved through existing `useEffect` in `enhanced-execution-form.tsx`
- The effect calls `form.onFieldChange()` which updates formData
- Updated formData is included in `buildSubmissionActivities()` output

**Verification:**
- Computed values (Section D and E) are part of formData
- They are included in the activities array during submission
- No additional code needed - existing mechanism works

### ✅ Requirement 5.3: Use existing endpoint without schema changes
**Implementation:**
- Payment fields are optional in TypeScript interfaces
- Backend receives them as additional fields on activity objects
- No breaking changes to existing API contract

**Verification:**
- Existing executions without payment data continue to work
- New executions include payment data
- API endpoint remains unchanged

### ✅ Requirement 5.4: Restore payment status from saved data
**Implementation:**
- Data transformation logic in `enhanced-execution-form-auto-load.tsx` extracts payment fields
- Fields are restored into formData when loading existing execution
- Form state is updated with restored payment data

**Verification:**
- Edit existing execution with payment data
- Verify payment controls show correct status
- Verify partial payment amounts are restored

### ✅ Requirement 5.5: Backward compatibility defaults
**Implementation:**
- Default values provided in multiple places:
  - Save: `paymentStatus: v?.paymentStatus || "unpaid"`
  - Save: `amountPaid: Number(v?.amountPaid) || 0`
  - Load: `paymentStatus: activityObj.paymentStatus || "unpaid"`
  - Load: `amountPaid: Number(activityObj.amountPaid) || 0`
  - Form initialization: Already handled in `use-execution-form.ts`

**Verification:**
- Load old execution without payment data
- Verify defaults are applied ("unpaid", 0)
- Verify no errors occur
- Verify form is editable and saveable

## Data Flow

### Save Flow
```
User Input (Payment Controls)
  ↓

  ↓
API Request (POST/PUT with payment data)
  ↓
Database (stores payment data)
```

### Load Flow
```
Database (contains payment data)
  ↓
API Response (activities with payment fields)
  ↓

  ↓
Form State (formData with paymentStatus & amountPaid)
  ↓
UI Rendering (payment controls show correct state)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

- [ ] **Test 1: Create new execution with payment data**
  - Enter expenses with mixed payment statuses
  - Verify save succeeds
  - Check network payload includes payment fields

- [ ] **Test 2: Load existing execution with payment data**
  - Edit saved execution
  - Verify payment statuses are restored
  - Verify partial amounts are correct

- [ ] **Test 3: Update execution (quarterly merge)**
  - Create Q1 with payment data
  - Update with Q2 data
  - Verify Q1 payment data is preserved
  - Verify Q2 payment data is added

- [ ] **Test 4: Backward compatibility**
  - Load old execution without payment data
  - Verify defaults are applied
  - Verify no errors
  - Verify can save with new payment data

- [ ] **Test 5: Computed values persistence**
  - Create execution with payments
  - Verify Cash at Bank and Payables compute
  - Save and reload
  - Verify computed values match

### Automated Testing
- No automated tests created due to lack of test infrastructure
- See `SAVE_LOAD_VERIFICATION.md` for detailed manual test procedures

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Missing payment fields in old data**: Defaults to "unpaid" and 0
2. **Undefined/null payment values**: Coerced to defaults
3. **Quarterly merges**: Payment data preserved for existing quarters
4. **Computed values**: Automatically saved through existing mechanism
5. **Temporary saves**: Payment data included in formValues (Record<string, any>)

## Known Limitations

1. **No validation on backend**: Backend should validate payment fields if needed
2. **No migration script**: Old records get defaults on first load
3. **No audit trail**: Payment status changes not tracked historically

## Future Enhancements

1. Add backend validation for payment data consistency
2. Add audit logging for payment status changes
3. Add bulk payment status update functionality
4. Add payment status filters in execution list
5. Add payment summary reports

## Verification Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Code review: All changes reviewed
- ✅ Requirements coverage: All 5 requirements addressed
- ⏳ Manual testing: Pending user verification
- ⏳ Integration testing: Pending user verification

## Conclusion

Task 7 has been successfully implemented. All save and load logic has been updated to include payment tracking data while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing records. The implementation follows the existing patterns in the codebase and requires no backend changes.

**Next Steps:**
1. User should perform manual testing using `SAVE_LOAD_VERIFICATION.md`
2. Verify with real data across different programs and facility types
3. Monitor for any issues in production
4. Consider adding automated tests in the future
