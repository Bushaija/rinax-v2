# Save and Load Logic Verification

## Overview
This document provides verification steps for Task 7: Update save and load logic for payment tracking.

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

1. **Save Logic (buildSubmissionActivities)**
   - Updated in 3 files:
     - `enhanced-execution-form.tsx`
     - `enhanced-execution-form-auto-load.tsx`
     - `enhanced-execution-form-updated.tsx`
   - Now includes `paymentStatus` and `amountPaid` in submission payload
   - Defaults: `paymentStatus: "unpaid"`, `amountPaid: 0`

2. **Load Logic (Data Transformation)**
   - Updated in `enhanced-execution-form-auto-load.tsx`
   - Restores `paymentStatus` and `amountPaid` from saved data
   - Provides backward compatibility defaults for old records

3. **Merge Logic (Smart Submission)**
   - Updated in `use-smart-execution-submission.ts`
   - Preserves payment data when merging quarterly updates
   - Updates payment fields when provided in new data

4. **TypeScript Interfaces**
   - Updated in `use-smart-execution-submission.ts` and `use-execution-submission-handler.ts`
   - Added optional `paymentStatus` and `amountPaid` fields to activity type

5. **Computed Values**
   - Cash at Bank (Section D) and Payables (Section E) are auto-updated via `useEffect`
   - These computed values are saved as part of formData through `onFieldChange`

## Verification Steps

### Test 1: Create New Execution with Payment Data

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to execution form (create mode)
2. Select project type, facility, and quarter
3. Enter expense amounts in Section B
4. Set payment status for each expense:
   - Mark some as "Fully Paid"
   - Mark some as "Unpaid"
   - Mark some as "Partially Paid" with specific amounts
5. Verify Cash at Bank (Section D) updates automatically
6. Verify Payables (Section E) update automatically
7. Click "Submit Execution"

**Expected Results:**
- Execution saves successfully
- No errors in console
- Success toast appears
- Redirects to execution list

**Verification:**
- Check browser network tab for the save request payload
- Verify payload includes:
  ```json
  {
    "formData": {
      "activities": [
        {
          "code": "...",
          "q1": 0,
          "q2": 0,
          "q3": 0,
          "q4": 0,
          "comment": "",
          "paymentStatus": "paid|unpaid|partial",
          "amountPaid": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

### Test 2: Load Existing Execution with Payment Data

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to execution list
2. Click "Edit" on the execution created in Test 1
3. Verify form loads with all data

**Expected Results:**
- All expense amounts are restored
- All payment statuses are restored (paid/unpaid/partial)
- Partial payment amounts are restored
- Cash at Bank shows correct computed value
- Payables show correct computed values

**Verification:**
- Check that payment controls show correct status
- Verify partial payment inputs show correct amounts
- Verify computed fields are read-only and show correct values

### Test 3: Update Existing Execution (Quarterly Merge)

**Steps:**
1. Create execution for Q1 with payment data
2. Save and close
3. Open same execution for Q2
4. Enter Q2 expense data with different payment statuses
5. Save

**Expected Results:**
- Q1 data is preserved (amounts and payment status)
- Q2 data is saved with new payment status
- Both quarters' data coexist in the same record
- Computed values reflect both quarters

**Verification:**
- Check database/API response to verify both quarters are present
- Verify Q1 payment data wasn't overwritten
- Verify Q2 payment data was added

### Test 4: Backward Compatibility (Old Records)

**Steps:**
1. Load an execution record created before payment tracking feature
2. Verify form loads without errors

**Expected Results:**
- Form loads successfully
- All expenses default to "unpaid" status
- `amountPaid` defaults to 0
- No errors in console
- User can edit and save the record

**Verification:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify payment controls appear with default "unpaid" state
- Verify saving works and adds payment data to old record

### Test 5: Computed Values Persistence

**Steps:**
1. Create execution with mixed payment statuses
2. Verify Cash at Bank and Payables compute correctly
3. Save execution
4. Reload the execution

**Expected Results:**
- Computed values are saved in the database
- On reload, computed values match what was shown before save
- Computed fields remain read-only

**Verification:**
- Check save payload includes computed values
- Check loaded data includes computed values
- Verify values are consistent before and after save

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 5.1: Save payment status and amount paid
✅ Implemented in `buildSubmissionActivities` - includes `paymentStatus` and `amountPaid`

### Requirement 5.2: Save computed Cash at Bank and payables
✅ Implemented via `useEffect` that updates formData with computed values

### Requirement 5.3: Use existing endpoint without schema changes
✅ No backend changes required - payment data added as optional fields

### Requirement 5.4: Restore payment status from saved data
✅ Implemented in data transformation logic with defaults

### Requirement 5.5: Backward compatibility defaults
✅ Defaults provided: `paymentStatus: "unpaid"`, `amountPaid: 0`

## Known Limitations

1. **No Unit Tests**: Due to lack of test infrastructure, verification relies on manual testing
2. **Type Safety**: Payment fields are optional in interfaces to maintain backward compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Payment data not saving
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `buildSubmissionActivities` is being called
- Check network tab for payload structure

### Issue: Payment data not loading
- Check if saved data includes payment fields
- Verify transformation logic is running
- Check for console errors during load

### Issue: Computed values incorrect after reload
- Verify `useExpenseCalculations` hook is running
- Check if opening balance is loaded correctly
- Verify expense-to-payable mapping is correct

## Next Steps

After verification:
1. Test with real data across different programs (HIV, Malaria, TB)
2. Test with different facility types (hospital, health_center)
3. Test edge cases (all paid, all unpaid, mixed)
4. Verify reporting still works with new data structure
