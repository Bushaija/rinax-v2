# Task 5 Verification: Comprehensive Error Handling and User Feedback

## Task Requirements

- [x] Implement ApiError handling with status-specific messages (403, 404, 400)
- [x] Add toast notifications for all success and error scenarios
- [x] Implement loading indicators on all action buttons
- [x] Add button disable logic during API calls to prevent duplicates
- [x] Handle network errors and unexpected failures gracefully

## Requirement 7 Acceptance Criteria

### 7.1: Loading Indicators
✅ **WHEN a User initiates an approval action, THE Client Application SHALL display a loading indicator**

**Implementation:**
- `ApprovalActionsCard`: Shows `Loader2` spinner on active button
- `ApprovalCommentsDialog`: Shows spinner in confirm button with "Processing..." text
- `PlanningTableColumns`: Shows spinner in dropdown trigger during action
- `PlanningTableToolbarActions`: Shows spinner in submit button with "Submitting..." text

**Files:**
- `apps/client/components/planning/approval-actions-card.tsx` (lines with Loader2)
- `apps/client/components/planning/approval-comments-dialog.tsx` (Loader2 in button)
- `apps/client/app/dashboard/planning/_components/planning-table-columns.tsx` (Loader2 in trigger)
- `apps/client/app/dashboard/planning/_components/planning-table-toolbar-actions.tsx` (Loader2 in button)

### 7.2: Success Notifications
✅ **WHEN an approval action succeeds, THE Client Application SHALL display a success toast notification with a descriptive message**

**Implementation:**
- `useApprovalErrorHandler` hook provides `handleSuccess()` method
- All components call `handleSuccess()` with descriptive messages
- Success toasts show operation result (e.g., "Plan approved successfully", "3 plan(s) submitted for approval")

**Files:**
- `apps/client/hooks/use-approval-error-handler.ts` (handleSuccess method)
- `apps/client/components/planning/approval-actions-card.tsx` (calls handleSuccess)
- `apps/client/app/dashboard/planning/_components/planning-table-columns.tsx` (calls handleSuccess)
- `apps/client/app/dashboard/planning/_components/planning-table-toolbar-actions.tsx` (calls handleSuccess)

### 7.3: Error Notifications
✅ **WHEN an approval action fails, THE Client Application SHALL display an error toast notification with the error message**

**Implementation:**
- `useApprovalErrorHandler` hook provides `handleError()` method with context
- Enhanced `ApiError` class with `getUserMessage()` for user-friendly messages
- Status-specific error handling (403, 404, 400, 409, 422, 500, 503, network errors)
- Contextual error messages (e.g., "Failed to approve this plan: Permission denied")

**Files:**
- `packages/api-client/src/index.ts` (ApiError.getUserMessage())
- `apps/client/hooks/use-approval-error-handler.ts` (handleError with status-specific logic)
- All approval components use handleError with context

### 7.4: Button Disable Logic
✅ **THE Client Application SHALL disable action buttons during processing to prevent duplicate submissions**

**Implementation:**
- All action buttons have `disabled={isLoading}` prop
- Related controls (inputs, other buttons) also disabled during processing
- Dropdown menu items disabled during table actions
- Dialog inputs disabled during processing

**Files:**
- `apps/client/components/planning/approval-actions-card.tsx` (both buttons disabled)
- `apps/client/components/planning/approval-comments-dialog.tsx` (all controls disabled)
- `apps/client/app/dashboard/planning/_components/planning-table-columns.tsx` (menu items disabled)
- `apps/client/app/dashboard/planning/_components/planning-table-toolbar-actions.tsx` (submit button disabled)

### 7.5: Re-enable After Completion
✅ **THE Client Application SHALL re-enable action buttons after the operation completes or fails**

**Implementation:**
- All components use `try/catch/finally` pattern
- `setIsLoading(false)` in finally block ensures re-enable
- Loading state reset regardless of success or failure

**Files:**
- All approval components implement proper finally blocks

## Additional Enhancements

### Enhanced ApiError Class
- `getUserMessage()`: User-friendly error messages
- `isNetworkError()`: Check for network errors
- `isPermissionError()`: Check for permission errors (401/403)
- `isValidationError()`: Check for validation errors (400/422)

### Error Utility Functions
Created `apps/client/lib/approval-error-utils.ts` with:
- `retryOperation()`: Retry with exponential backoff
- `getApprovalErrorMessage()`: Format errors with context
- `isRecoverableError()`: Check if error is recoverable
- `formatValidationErrors()`: Format Zod validation errors

### Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `apps/client/docs/approval-error-handling.md`: Complete error handling guide
- Error handling by status code table
- Best practices and testing scenarios
- Future enhancement suggestions

## Status-Specific Error Messages

| Status | Implemented | User Message |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 400 | ✅ | "Invalid request. Please check your input and try again." |
| 401 | ✅ | "You are not authenticated. Please log in and try again." |
| 403 | ✅ | "You do not have permission to perform this action." |
| 404 | ✅ | "The requested resource was not found." |
| 409 | ✅ | "This action conflicts with the current state." |
| 422 | ✅ | "Validation failed. Please check your input." |

| 503 | ✅ | "The service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later." |
| 0 (Network) | ✅ | "Network error. Please check your connection and try again." |

## Components Updated
