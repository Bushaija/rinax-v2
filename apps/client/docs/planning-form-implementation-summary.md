# Planning Form Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a new schema-driven planning form that integrates with the planning module actions. The new implementation replaces the hardcoded program-specific forms (HIV, Malaria, TB) with a flexible, database-driven approach.

## Key Components Created

### 1. PlanningForm Component (`apps/client/features/planning/components/planning-form.tsx`)

A new React component that provides a comprehensive form interface for creating and editing planning data. Key features:

- **Schema-driven**: Uses database schemas to determine form structure
- **Dynamic activities**: Loads activities from the database based on project type and facility type
- **Real-time calculations**: Automatically calculates quarterly amounts and totals
- **Form validation**: Uses Zod schema validation for client-side validation
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly layout with proper spacing

### 2. usePlanningForm Hook (`apps/client/hooks/use-planning-form.ts`)

A custom React hook that manages the planning form state and logic:

- **Data fetching**: Loads activities, schemas, and existing data
- **Form management**: Handles form state, validation, and submission
- **Calculations**: Computes category totals and grand totals
- **Helper functions**: Provides utilities for updating and retrieving activity data
- **Error handling**: Manages loading states and error conditions

### 3. Updated Planning New Page (`apps/client/app/dashboard/planning/new/page.tsx`)

Updated the planning new page to use the new PlanningForm component:

- **Clean interface**: Simple, focused page layout
- **Navigation**: Proper routing and navigation handling
- **Success handling**: Toast notifications and navigation on success

## Integration with Planning Actions

The new implementation directly integrates with the planning module server actions:

### Actions Used:
- `getPlanningActivities()` - Fetches activities for a specific project/facility type
- `getPlanningFormSchema()` - Retrieves the form schema configuration
- `getPlanningDataSummary()` - Loads existing planning data for editing
- `createPlanningData()` - Creates new planning entries
- `updatePlanningData()` - Updates existing planning entries

### Data Flow:
1. **Load Phase**: Fetch activities, schema, and existing data
2. **Form Phase**: User interacts with the form, real-time calculations update
3. **Submit Phase**: Form data is validated and submitted via server actions
4. **Success Phase**: User receives feedback and is redirected

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Activity Loading
- Activities are loaded from the database based on project type (HIV, Malaria, TB) and facility type (hospital, health_center)
- Activities are grouped by category for better organization
- Each activity can have different configurations (annual only, total rows, etc.)

### 2. Real-time Calculations
- Unit cost Ã— count calculations for each quarter
- Category-level totals
- Grand total across all categories
- Automatic updates as user types

### 3. Form Validation
- Client-side validation using Zod schemas
- Required field validation
- Number range validation
- Real-time validation feedback

### 4. Error Handling
- Loading states with spinners
- Error messages for failed operations
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### 5. Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Proper spacing and typography
- Accessible form controls
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Database Schema Integration

The form integrates with the following database tables:

- `dynamic_activities` - Activity definitions
- `schema_activity_categories` - Activity categories
- `form_schemas` - Form configuration
- `schema_form_data_entries` - Stored form data

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { PlanningForm } from '@/features/planning/components/planning-form';

function MyPlanningPage() {
  const handleSuccess = (data: any) => {
    console.log('Planning data saved:', data);
    // Navigate or show success message
  };

  return (
    <PlanningForm
      projectId="1"
      facilityId="1"
      reportingPeriodId="1"
      projectType="HIV"
      facilityType="health_center"
      isEdit={false}
      isReadOnly={false}
      onSuccess={handleSuccess}
      onCancel={() => router.back()}
    />
  );
}
```

## Benefits of New Implementation

### 1. Flexibility
- No hardcoded schemas - everything is database-driven
- Easy to add new project types or facility types
- Configurable form fields and validation rules

### 2. Maintainability
- Single form component handles all program types
- Centralized logic in the custom hook
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Performance
- Efficient data loading with proper caching
- Real-time calculations without unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized form validation

### 4. User Experience
- Consistent interface across all program types
- Real-time feedback and calculations
- Clear error messages and loading states
- Mobile-responsive design

## Migration from Old System

The new implementation is designed to work alongside the existing system:

1. **Gradual Migration**: Can be rolled out program by program
2. **Data Compatibility**: Uses the same database schema
3. **API Compatibility**: Integrates with existing server actions
4. **Feature Parity**: Provides all functionality of the old system

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk edit capabilities
2. **Advanced Validation**: Server-side validation rules
3. **Audit Trail**: Track changes and modifications
4. **Export/Import**: Data export and import functionality
5. **Templates**: Save and reuse form templates
6. **Collaboration**: Multi-user editing capabilities

## Testing

The implementation includes:

- Form validation testing
- Error handling verification
- Data flow testing
- UI component testing
- Integration testing with server actions

## Conclusion

The new planning form implementation provides a robust, flexible, and user-friendly interface for managing planning data. It successfully integrates with the existing database schema and server actions while providing significant improvements in maintainability, flexibility, and user experience.
