# Task 13: DAF Approval Queue Interface - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive DAF (Directeur Administratif et Financier) approval queue interface that integrates with the facility hierarchy system to display and manage financial reports pending DAF approval.

## Requirements Addressed
- **6.1-6.4**: DAF approval queue with facility hierarchy filtering
- **5.2**: DAF role-based permissions and approval actions
- **3.1-3.3**: District-based approval workflow integration

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Integration

#### Created Fetcher (`get-daf-queue.ts`)
- Fetches reports from `/financial-reports/daf-queue` endpoint
- Supports pagination (page, limit)
- Returns reports with facility hierarchy context
- Includes submitter details and facility information

#### Created React Query Hook (`use-get-daf-queue.ts`)
- Wraps the fetcher with React Query
- Implements automatic refetching on window focus
- 30-second stale time for optimal performance
- Proper query key structure for cache management

### 2. Enhanced Components

#### Updated `DafReviewCard` Component
Enhanced to display:
- Facility name with hierarchy context
- Facility type badge (Hospital/Health Center)
- District information
- Submitter name
- Formatted submission date
- Project information
- Fiscal year

#### Updated `DafApprovalQueuePage`
Key features:
- **Hierarchy Context Display**: Shows user's facility and accessible facilities count
- **Facility Information**: Displays facility type and district for each report
- **Enhanced Report Details**: Shows complete facility hierarchy context in review panel
- **Hierarchy Validation**: Error messages for cross-hierarchy access attempts
- **Pagination Support**: Ready for large approval queues
- **Real-time Updates**: Invalidates cache after approve/reject actions

### 3. Navigation Integration

#### Updated `nav-data.ts`
- Enabled "Approvals" navigation section
- Added "DAF Queue" link visible only to DAF role users
- Includes keyboard shortcut ['d', 'q']
- Properly nested under Approvals section

### 4. Hierarchy Context Integration

The page uses `useHierarchyContext` hook to:
- Get user's facility information
- Display accessible facilities count
- Show facility type and district
- Validate hierarchy access

### 5. User Experience Enhancements

#### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear facility hierarchy display with badges
- District information prominently shown
- Submitter information for accountability
- Facility type indicators (Hospital/Health Center)

#### Error Handling
- Hierarchy-specific error messages
- Clear feedback for access denied scenarios
- Toast notifications for all actions

#### Loading States
- Skeleton loading for reports list
- Loading indicators for actions
- Proper empty state messaging

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files

   - Replaced old status-based filtering with new endpoint
   - Added hierarchy context display
   - Enhanced report details with facility information
   - Improved error handling

2. `apps/client/components/financial-reports/daf-review-card.tsx`
   - Added facility hierarchy context display
   - Enhanced with facility type badges
   - Added district information
   - Improved submitter information display

3. `apps/client/fetchers/financial-reports/index.ts`
   - Exported new `get-daf-queue` fetcher

4. `apps/client/hooks/queries/financial-reports/index.ts`
   - Exported new `useGetDafQueue` hook

5. `apps/client/constants/nav-data.ts`
   - Enabled Approvals navigation section
   - Added DAF Queue link for DAF users

## Key Features

### 1. Facility Hierarchy Display
```typescript
// Shows user's facility with type and district
<Building2 /> Butaro Hospital [Hospital] - Burera District
Accessible Facilities: 15
```

### 2. Report Cards with Context
Each report card displays:
- Facility name and type
- District information
- Submitter name
- Submission date
- Project and fiscal year

### 3. Detailed Review Panel
When a report is selected:
- Highlighted facility hierarchy context
- Facility type badge
- District information
- Submitter details
- Complete report metadata
- Link to view full report

### 4. Hierarchy Validation
- Approve/reject actions validate hierarchy access
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access
- Automatic cache invalidation on success

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **DAF User Login**: Verify DAF queue appears in navigation
2. **Queue Display**: Check reports from accessible facilities appear
3. **Hierarchy Context**: Verify facility information is correct
4. **Approve Action**: Test approval with hierarchy validation
5. **Reject Action**: Test rejection with required comment
6. **Cross-Hierarchy**: Verify access denied for out-of-hierarchy reports
7. **Empty State**: Check message when no reports pending
8. **Pagination**: Test with large number of reports

### Integration Testing
1. Health center report → Hospital DAF approval
2. Hospital report → Same hospital DAF approval
3. Cross-district access blocked
4. Multiple facilities in hierarchy
5. Workflow timeline display
6. Cache invalidation after actions

## Security Considerations

1. **Server-Side Validation**: All hierarchy checks performed on server
2. **Client-Side Feedback**: Clear error messages for unauthorized access
3. **Role-Based Access**: Navigation only visible to DAF users
4. **Hierarchy Enforcement**: Reports filtered by accessible facilities

## Performance Optimizations

1. **React Query Caching**: 30-second stale time reduces API calls
2. **Automatic Refetch**: Updates on window focus for fresh data
3. **Pagination Support**: Ready for large approval queues
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Cache invalidation after mutations

## Next Steps

1. **Task 14**: Implement DG approval queue interface (similar pattern)
2. **Task 15**: Update user management UI with hierarchy
3. **Task 16**: Add facility hierarchy tree visualization
4. **Task 17**: Update API client methods (if needed)

## Notes

- The implementation follows the existing pattern from the financial reports module
- All components are reusable for the DG queue (Task 14)
- Hierarchy context hook provides consistent facility information
- Navigation is properly role-gated for security
- Error handling includes hierarchy-specific messages
