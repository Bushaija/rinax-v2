# Task 14: DG Approval Queue Interface - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the DG (Directeur Général) approval queue interface for final approval of financial reports. This interface allows DG users to review and provide final approval for reports that have been approved by DAF users within their facility hierarchy.

## Requirements Addressed
- **6.1-6.4**: DG approval queue with facility hierarchy filtering and pagination
- **5.3**: Complete workflow timeline including DAF actions
- **3.4-3.8**: Final approval and rejection actions with hierarchy validation

## Components Created

### 1. DG Queue Fetcher (`apps/client/fetchers/financial-reports/get-dg-queue.ts`)
- Fetches reports with status `approved_by_daf` from `/financial-reports/dg-queue` endpoint
- Includes pagination support (page, limit)
- Returns reports with facility details, DAF approval information, and submitter details
- Properly typed with `GetDgQueueRequest` and `GetDgQueueResponse`

### 2. DG Queue Hook (`apps/client/hooks/queries/financial-reports/use-get-dg-queue.ts`)
- React Query hook for fetching DG approval queue
- Auto-refetches on window focus
- 30-second stale time for optimal performance
- Includes pagination parameters in query key

### 3. Enhanced DG Review Card (`apps/client/components/financial-reports/dg-review-card.tsx`)
- Displays report code, title, and status badge
- Shows facility hierarchy context (name, type, district)
- Highlights DAF approval details with green badge:
  - DAF approver name
  - Approval timestamp
  - DAF comment (if provided)
- Shows submitter information
- Displays project and fiscal year
- Responsive and accessible design

### 4. DG Approval Queue Page (`apps/client/app/dashboard/financial-reports/dg-queue/page.tsx`)
- Full-featured approval interface with three-column layout:
  - **Left Column**: List of pending reports with DG review cards
  - **Right Column**: Selected report details, DAF approval info, and actions
- **Hierarchy Context Card**: Shows user's facility and accessible facilities count
- **Report Details Section**:
  - Facility hierarchy context with badges
  - DAF approval details (approver, timestamp, comment)
  - Report metadata (fiscal year, submission date, project)
  - Link to view full report in new tab
- **Final Approval Actions**: Uses `FinalApprovalActionsCard` component
- **Workflow Timeline**: Complete history including DAF actions
- **Approval Dialog**: Supports optional comments for approval, required for rejection
- **Error Handling**: Hierarchy-aware error messages
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators throughout

## Key Features

### Hierarchy-Aware Access Control
- Integrates with `useHierarchyContext` hook
- Displays user's facility and accessible facilities
- Server-side filtering ensures only accessible reports are shown
- Hierarchy validation on approve/reject actions

### Complete Workflow Visibility
- Shows full workflow timeline including:
  - Initial submission by accountant
  - DAF approval with approver details
  - All comments and timestamps
- DAF approval details prominently displayed in green badge
- Clear indication of approval chain

### Final Approval Actions
- **Approve**: Provides final approval, generates PDF, locks report permanently
- **Reject**: Returns report to accountant with required comment
- Both actions validate hierarchy access
- Success/error toasts with contextual messages
- Automatic queue refresh after actions

### User Experience
- Clean, intuitive interface matching DAF queue design
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Empty state when no reports pending
- Selected report highlighting
- Keyboard shortcuts support (via navigation)
- Accessible components throughout

## Navigation Integration
The DG Queue is already integrated into the navigation system:
- **Location**: Approvals section in sidebar
- **Title**: "DG Queue"
- **Icon**: ClipboardCheck
- **Shortcut**: ['d', 'g']
- **Role**: Only visible to users with 'dg' role
- **URL**: `/dashboard/financial-reports/dg-queue`

## API Integration
Connects to server endpoints:
- `GET /financial-reports/dg-queue` - Fetch pending reports
- `POST /financial-reports/:id/dg-approve` - Final approval
- `POST /financial-reports/:id/dg-reject` - Rejection
- `GET /financial-reports/:id/workflow-logs` - Workflow history

## State Management
- React Query for server state
- Local state for selected report and dialog
- Optimistic updates with cache invalidation
- Proper loading and error states

## Validation & Security
- Role-based access (DG only)
- Hierarchy validation on all actions
- Required comment for rejection
- Server-side authorization checks
- Error messages indicate hierarchy violations

## Testing Considerations
The implementation is ready for testing:
1. **Role Access**: Only DG users can access the queue
2. **Hierarchy Filtering**: Reports from accessible facilities only
3. **DAF Approval Display**: Shows DAF approver and details
4. **Workflow Timeline**: Complete history visible
5. **Approval Actions**: Final approve generates PDF
6. **Rejection Flow**: Returns to accountant with comment
7. **Cross-District Protection**: Cannot approve outside district
8. **Empty State**: Proper message when no reports pending

## Verification Checklist
- ✅ DG queue fetcher created with proper typing
- ✅ React Query hook created with caching
- ✅ DG review card enhanced with DAF approval details
- ✅ DG approval queue page created with full functionality
- ✅ Facility hierarchy context displayed
- ✅ DAF approval details prominently shown
- ✅ Complete workflow timeline included
- ✅ Final approval actions implemented
- ✅ Rejection flow with required comment
- ✅ Navigation link already exists in nav-data.ts

## Next Steps
The DG approval queue interface is complete and ready for use. DG users can now:
1. View reports approved by DAF from their facility hierarchy
2. See complete workflow history including DAF actions
3. Provide final approval or reject with comments
4. Access the queue via the Approvals section in the sidebar

The implementation maintains consistency with the DAF queue while adding DG-specific features like DAF approval details and final approval actions.
