# Task 15: Client User Management UI - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Updated the user management UI to support DAF and DG roles with facility hierarchy visualization and validation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced User Form (`user-form.tsx`)
- ✅ Added 'daf' and 'dg' to the userRoles array
- ✅ Imported HierarchyFacilitySelector component
- ✅ Added role watching to conditionally render facility selector
- ✅ Conditionally renders HierarchyFacilitySelector for DAF/DG roles
- ✅ Shows hospital-only requirement hint for DAF/DG roles
- ✅ Falls back to standard FacilitySelector for other roles

### 2. Created Hierarchy Facility Selector (`hierarchy-facility-selector.tsx`)
- ✅ New component for hierarchical facility selection
- ✅ Groups facilities by district for better organization
- ✅ Shows facility type badges (Hospital/Health Center)
- ✅ Displays child health center count for hospitals
- ✅ Supports `hospitalOnly` prop to filter only hospitals
- ✅ Shows hierarchy information in the dropdown
- ✅ Includes helpful hint text for DAF/DG role requirements
- ✅ Fully accessible with ARIA labels

### 3. Updated Create User Sheet (`create-user-sheet.tsx`)
- ✅ Added 'daf' and 'dg' to role enum in schema
- ✅ Added schema refinement for DAF/DG validation (client-side UX)
- ✅ Server-side validation handles actual hospital facility check

### 4. Updated Update User Sheet (`update-user-sheet.tsx`)
- ✅ Added 'daf' and 'dg' to role enum in schema
- ✅ Added schema refinement for DAF/DG validation (client-side UX)
- ✅ Maintains consistency with create user validation

### 5. Enhanced Users Table Columns (`users-table-columns.tsx`)
- ✅ Added 'daf' and 'dg' to userRoles array
- ✅ Added role icons for DAF (CheckCircle2) and DG (Shield)
- ✅ Added role badge variants for DAF (default) and DG (destructive)
- ✅ Enhanced facility column to show facility type badge for DAF/DG users
- ✅ Displays "Hospital" or "Health Center" badge with appropriate styling
- ✅ Improved visual distinction for approval roles

## Features Implemented

### Facility Hierarchy Visualization
The HierarchyFacilitySelector provides:
- **District Grouping**: Facilities organized by district
- **Hierarchy Display**: Shows parent-child relationships
- **Child Count**: Displays number of health centers for each hospital
- **Type Badges**: Visual indicators for Hospital vs Health Center
- **Search**: Filter facilities by name or district
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop

### Validation
- **Client-side**: Form validation prevents submission with invalid data
- **Server-side**: Backend validates hospital facility requirement for DAF/DG
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and hints
- **Visual Cues**: Hospital-only requirement shown in label

### User Experience
- **Conditional Rendering**: Shows appropriate selector based on role
- **Clear Labels**: Explains requirements for DAF/DG roles
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Easy to understand facility relationships
- **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support for screen readers

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 7.1: User Creation with DAF/DG Roles
✅ System creates users with 'daf' or 'dg' roles
✅ FacilityId is required for DAF/DG roles

### Requirement 7.2: Hospital Facility Validation
✅ System validates DAF/DG roles are assigned to hospital facilities
✅ Client-side validation provides immediate feedback
✅ Server-side validation ensures data integrity

### Requirement 7.3: Role Update Validation
✅ System validates facility type when updating to DAF/DG role
✅ Consistent validation between create and update flows

### Requirement 7.4: Facility Hierarchy Display
✅ Administrators can view facility hierarchy when assigning roles
✅ HierarchyFacilitySelector shows parent-child relationships
✅ District grouping provides clear organizational structure

### Requirement 7.5: User List Display
✅ User lists show facility name for DAF/DG users
✅ Facility type badge displayed for approval roles
✅ Visual distinction between Hospital and Health Center

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Create DAF User**
   - [ ] Select DAF role
   - [ ] Verify HierarchyFacilitySelector appears
   - [ ] Verify only hospitals are shown
   - [ ] Verify hospital selection works
   - [ ] Verify user creation succeeds

2. **Create DG User**
   - [ ] Select DG role
   - [ ] Verify HierarchyFacilitySelector appears
   - [ ] Verify only hospitals are shown
   - [ ] Verify hospital selection works
   - [ ] Verify user creation succeeds

3. **Create Accountant User**
   - [ ] Select Accountant role
   - [ ] Verify standard FacilitySelector appears
   - [ ] Verify all facilities are shown
   - [ ] Verify facility selection works
   - [ ] Verify user creation succeeds

4. **Update User to DAF/DG**
   - [ ] Open existing user
   - [ ] Change role to DAF
   - [ ] Verify HierarchyFacilitySelector appears
   - [ ] Verify hospital-only filtering
   - [ ] Verify update succeeds

5. **Users Table Display**
   - [ ] Create DAF user at hospital
   - [ ] Verify facility column shows "Hospital" badge
   - [ ] Create DG user at hospital
   - [ ] Verify facility column shows "Hospital" badge
   - [ ] Verify accountant users don't show badge

6. **Hierarchy Visualization**
   - [ ] Open HierarchyFacilitySelector
   - [ ] Verify facilities grouped by district
   - [ ] Verify hospitals show child count
   - [ ] Verify search works correctly
   - [ ] Verify selection updates form

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] User with invalid facility (facility doesn't exist)
- [ ] User with health center facility trying to become DAF
- [ ] Empty facilities list
- [ ] Network error loading facilities
- [ ] Very long facility names (truncation)
- [ ] District with many health centers (scrolling)

## Files Modified
1. `apps/client/app/dashboard/admin/users/_components/user-form.tsx`
2. `apps/client/app/dashboard/admin/users/_components/create-user-sheet.tsx`
3. `apps/client/app/dashboard/admin/users/_components/update-user-sheet.tsx`
4. `apps/client/app/dashboard/admin/users/_components/users-table-columns.tsx`

## Files Created
1. `apps/client/components/hierarchy-facility-selector.tsx`

## Dependencies
- Existing FacilitySelector component
- useGetAllFacilities hook
- shadcn/ui components (Command, Popover, Badge, etc.)
- React Hook Form
- Zod validation

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation manually
2. Verify server-side validation works correctly
3. Test with real data in development environment
4. Gather user feedback on hierarchy visualization
5. Consider adding facility hierarchy tree view (Task 16)

## Notes
- Server-side validation is the source of truth for hospital facility requirement
- Client-side validation provides better UX but doesn't replace server validation
- HierarchyFacilitySelector is reusable for other components
- Facility type badges use consistent color scheme with other components
