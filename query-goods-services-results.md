## Expected Results

Based on the seeder code analysis, we expect to see:

### B. Expenditures Activities (All Subcategories)

**B-01: Human Resources + Bonus**
- Laboratory Technician
- Nurse

**B-02: Monitoring & Evaluation**
- Supervision CHWs
- Support group meetings

**B-03: Living Support to Clients**
- Sample transport
- Home visit lost to follow up
- Transport and travel for survey/surveillance

**B-04: Overheads (Use of goods & services)**
- Communication - Airtime
- Communication - Internet
- Infrastructure support
- Office supplies
- Transport and travel (Reporting)
- Bank charges

**Note:** "Transfer to RBC" (B-05) should NOT appear here as it's explicitly mapped to GRANTS_TRANSFERS.

### Expected Pattern
- All should have `is_fallback_mapping = 'true'`
- All should have `is_auto_generated = 'true'`
- All should have `mapping_type = 'DIRECT'`
- All should have `mapping_ratio = '1.0000'`
- Should appear for both facility types (hospital and health_center)
- Should appear for all three project types (HIV, Malaria, TB)

### Total Expected Count
- 13 activities per facility type per project type
- 13 × 2 facility types × 3 projects = **78 total mappings**
