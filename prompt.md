next, this has to do with cash flow preparation.

how is the  `cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period` of the current fiscal year & `cash and cash equivalents at end of period` of the previous year being generated?

the `cash and cash equivalents at end of period` in the previous fiscal year, should be equivalent to `cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period` of current fiscal year.


------

let's talk about two significant events and how they should be prepared in the cash flow statement.

changes in receivables given amount of current and previous fiscal years
changes in payables given amount of current and previous fiscal years

1. Changes in Receivables

 What it means:

- Accounts receivable (A/R) represents money owed to the business by customers.
- An increase in A/R means the company sold more on credit and has not received cash.
- A decrease in A/R means the company collected more cash from past sales.

example
:| Year        | Accounts Receivable |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| 2024 Fiscal | $40,000             |
| 2025 Fiscal | $50,000             |

Change = $50,000 - $40,000 = +10,000

Cash Flow Adjustment = Subtract $10,000 from net income in cash flow from operating activities.

2. Changes in Payables

What it means:

- Accounts payable (A/P) represents money the company owes to suppliers.
- An increase in A/P means the company is delaying payment, which preserves cash.
- A decrease in A/P means the company is paying off more debts, reducing cash.

Cash Flow Statement Treatment (Indirect Method):

- Add any increase in payables (cash inflow)
- Subtract any decrease in payables (cash outflow)| Year        | Accounts Payable |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 2024 Fiscal | $25,000          |
| 2025 Fiscal | $18,000          |
Change = $18,000 - $25,000 = -7,000

Cash Flow Adjustment = Subtract $7,000 from net income in cash flow from operating activities.

summary:| Adjustment Type         | Increase in Amount | Decrease in Amount |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Accounts Receivable** | Subtract (−)       | Add (+)            |
| **Accounts Payable**    | Add (+)            | Subtract (−)       |
