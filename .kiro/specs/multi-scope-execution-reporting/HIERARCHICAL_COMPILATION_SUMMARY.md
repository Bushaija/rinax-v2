# Hierarchical Compilation Implementation Summary

## Overview

Updated the Multi-Scope Execution Reporting design to implement a hierarchical "compile down" approach that follows the natural organizational structure. This provides meaningful aggregation at each level while improving performance and usability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Design Philosophy Update

**Before**: Each scope showed all individual facilities filtered by geographic area
- District: All facilities in district
- Provincial: All facilities in province  
- Country: All facilities nationwide

**After**: Each scope shows appropriate aggregation level
- District: Individual facilities (operational detail)
- Provincial: District summaries (management view)
- Country: Provincial summaries (executive view)

### 2. Column Representation by Scope

| Scope | Columns Represent | Example | Column Count |
|-------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| District | Individual facilities | Hospital A, HC A1, HC A2 | 10-20 |
| Provincial | District hospitals (pre-aggregated) | Gasabo District, Kicukiro District | 5-10 |
| Country | Provinces (pre-aggregated) | Kigali, Eastern, Northern | 5 |

### 3. Aggregation Roll-up

```
Health Center → District Hospital → Province → Country
```

Each level aggregates the level below:
- **District Hospital** = Hospital + all its child health centers
- **Province** = All district hospitals (and their HCs) in the province
- **Country** = All provinces

### 4. Performance Benefits

**Column Reduction**:
- Provincial scope: 50-70% fewer columns than district scope
- Country scope: 95% fewer columns (5 vs 100+)

**Data Transfer**:
- Smaller payloads for higher-level views
- Faster rendering with fewer columns
- Better user experience for executive dashboards

### 5. Visual Example

**District Scope - Gasabo District**:
```
| Activity | Hospital A | HC A1 | HC A2 | Hospital B | HC B1 | Total |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|-------|
| A1.1     | 1000      | 200   | 150   | 800       | 180   | 2330  |
```

**Provincial Scope - Kigali Province**:
```
| Activity | Gasabo District | Kicukiro District | Nyarugenge District | Total |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| A1.1     | 2330           | 1500              | 1800                | 5630  |
```
Note: "Gasabo District" = Hospital A + HC A1 + HC A2 + Hospital B + HC B1

**Country Scope - Rwanda**:
```
| Activity | Kigali | Eastern | Northern | Southern | Western | Total  |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| A1.1     | 5630   | 4200    | 3800     | 4500     | 3900    | 22030  |
```
Note: "Kigali" = All facilities in Gasabo + Kicukiro + Nyarugenge + other districts

## Implementation Changes

### Design Document Updates

1. **Added Hierarchical Compilation Strategy section**
   - Explains aggregation logic for each scope
   - Provides code examples for column builders
   - Shows how facilities map to columns

2. **Updated Response Schema**
   - Changed `facilities` to `columns` (more flexible naming)
   - Added `type` field: 'facility' | 'district' | 'province'
   - Added `aggregatedFacilityCount` to show underlying facility count
   - Updated metadata to reflect column-based aggregation

3. **Added Visual Examples section**
   - Shows actual report structure for each scope
   - Demonstrates column reduction benefits
   - Makes the concept immediately clear

4. **Updated Implementation Flow**
   - Added column builder functions
   - Shows scope-specific aggregation logic
   - Explains how to map facilities to appropriate columns

### Client-Side Updates

1. **Enhanced Scope Selector Labels**
   - District Level (Individual Facilities)
   - Provincial Level (District Summaries)
   - Country Level (Provincial Summaries)

2. **Added Contextual Help Text**
   - District: "Columns show individual facilities (hospitals and health centers)"
   - Provincial: "Columns show district hospitals (each aggregated with their health centers)"
   - Country: "Columns show provinces (all facilities aggregated by province)"

3. **Maintained Existing Functionality**
   - Admin/accountant role-based access
   - Province selection for provincial scope
   - Fiscal year switching
   - Export functionality

## Benefits

### For Users

1. **Clarity**: Each level shows the right granularity for that audience
2. **Performance**: Faster loading and rendering at higher levels
3. **Usability**: Fewer columns = easier to read and understand
4. **Scalability**: Works well even with 100+ facilities

### For Developers

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns by scope
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new scope types (regional, zone)
3. **Performance**: Reduced data transfer and processing
4. **Testing**: Each scope can be tested independently

### For the Organization

1. **Alignment**: Mirrors real-world organizational structure
2. **Reporting**: Appropriate detail at each management level
3. **Decision-making**: Right information for the right audience
4. **Scalability**: Supports growth without performance degradation

## Next Steps

### Server-Side Implementation

1. Implement column builder functions:
   - `buildFacilityColumns()` for district scope
   - `buildDistrictColumns()` for provincial scope
   - `buildProvinceColumns()` for country scope

2. Update aggregation logic:
   - `aggregateActivitiesByColumns()` to sum by column type
   - `getColumnIdForFacility()` to map facilities to columns

3. Update response structure:
   - Return `columns` instead of `facilities`
   - Include `type` and `aggregatedFacilityCount` in each column
   - Update metadata with column-based counts

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test column builders for each scope
   - Test facility-to-column mapping
   - Test aggregation logic

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify correct column count for each scope
   - Verify aggregation accuracy
   - Test with real data

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure query time for each scope
   - Verify column reduction benefits
   - Test with large datasets (100+ facilities)

## Files Modified

1. `.kiro/specs/multi-scope-execution-reporting/design.md`
   - Added hierarchical compilation strategy
   - Updated response schema
   - Added visual examples
   - Updated implementation flow

2. `apps/client/app/dashboard/compiled/page.tsx`
   - Enhanced scope selector labels
   - Added contextual help text
   - Improved user guidance

3. `apps/client/hooks/queries/executions/use-get-compiled-execution.ts`
   - Added scope and provinceId to query key

4. `apps/client/fetchers/provinces/get-provinces.ts` (new)
   - Created provinces fetcher

5. `apps/client/hooks/queries/provinces/use-get-provinces.ts` (new)
   - Created provinces query hook

## Conclusion

The hierarchical compilation approach provides a clean, scalable solution that:
- Follows natural organizational structure
- Improves performance at higher levels
- Provides appropriate detail for each audience
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Sets foundation for future enhancements

This design is ready for server-side implementation and will significantly improve the usability and performance of multi-scope reporting.
