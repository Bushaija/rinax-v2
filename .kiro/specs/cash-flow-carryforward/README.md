# Cash Flow Beginning Cash Carryforward Feature

## Overview

This feature automatically carries forward the ending cash balance from the previous fiscal year's cash flow statement to the beginning cash balance of the current fiscal year's cash flow statement.

## Problem Statement

Currently, beginning and ending cash balances are manually entered as execution data. This creates:
- Risk of data entry errors
- No automatic continuity between periods
- Potential for lost or incorrect balances
- Manual reconciliation burden

## Solution

Implement a **CarryforwardService** that:
1. Identifies the previous reporting period
2. Retrieves the previous period's cash flow statement
3. Extracts the ending cash balance
4. Uses it as the current period's beginning cash
5. Validates consistency and generates warnings
6. Falls back to manual entry if needed

## Key Features

- ✅ Automatic carryforward from previous period
- ✅ Support for ANNUAL, QUARTERLY, and MONTHLY periods
- ✅ Facility-specific carryforward
- ✅ Project-specific carryforward (HIV, Malaria, TB)
- ✅ Multi-facility aggregation for district statements
- ✅ Manual override capability with warnings
- ✅ Robust error handling and fallback
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive validation

## Documents

- **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - Detailed requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **[design.md](./design.md)** - Technical design with architecture, components, and data models
- **[tasks.md](./tasks.md)** - Implementation tasks broken down into manageable steps

## Getting Started

To implement this feature:

1. Review the requirements document
2. Understand the design architecture
3. Open `tasks.md` in Kiro
4. Click "Start task" next to Task 1
5. Follow the implementation plan phase by phase

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Service** - Foundation and previous period identification
2. **Phase 2: Data Retrieval** - Statement retrieval and manual entry logic
3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features** - Multi-facility and validation
4. **Phase 4: Integration** - Connect to statement generation
5. **Phase 5: Optimization & Testing** - Performance and quality
6. **Phase 6: Documentation** - Docs, logging, and monitoring

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for all service methods
- Integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Performance tests for query optimization
- Edge case testing for error scenarios

## Success Criteria

The feature is successful when:
- Beginning cash automatically uses previous period's ending cash
- Manual overrides work with appropriate warnings
- District aggregation correctly sums facility balances
- Error handling gracefully falls back to manual entry
- Performance meets requirements (< 5 seconds)
- All validation rules pass

## Next Steps

After implementation:
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Test with real data
3. Train users on new functionality
4. Monitor carryforward success rate
5. Gather feedback and iterate
