# Task 3 Implementation Summary: Aggregation Metadata Builder

## Overview
Successfully implemented the aggregation metadata builder function that creates comprehensive metadata about aggregation levels, included facilities, and data completeness statistics for financial statements.

## Implementation Details

### Task 3.1: Create buildAggregationMetadata Function
**Location:** `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

**Function Signature:**
```typescript
async function buildAggregationMetadata(
  aggregationLevel: 'FACILITY' | 'DISTRICT' | 'PROVINCE',
  effectiveFacilityIds: number[],
  planningData: any,
  executionData: any
): Promise<any>
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Base Metadata Structure:**
   - `level`: The aggregation level (FACILITY, DISTRICT, or PROVINCE)
   - `facilitiesIncluded`: Array of facility IDs included in the aggregation
   - `totalFacilities`: Count of facilities in the aggregation
   - `dataCompleteness`: Statistics about data availability

2. **Facility-Level Metadata (when aggregationLevel = 'FACILITY'):**
   - `facilityId`: ID of the facility
   - `facilityName`: Name of the facility
   - `facilityType`: Type of the facility

3. **District-Level Metadata (when aggregationLevel = 'DISTRICT'):**
   - `districtId`: ID of the district
   - `districtName`: Name of the district

4. **Province-Level Metadata (when aggregationLevel = 'PROVINCE'):**
   - `provinceId`: ID of the province
   - `provinceName`: Name of the province

### Task 3.2: Add Data Completeness Analysis
**Implementation:**
- Analyzes planning data to identify facilities with budget data
- Analyzes execution data to identify facilities with actual expenditure data
- Calculates intersection to find facilities with both planning and execution data

**Data Completeness Fields:**
```typescript
dataCompleteness: {
  facilitiesWithPlanning: number,    // Count of facilities with budget data
  facilitiesWithExecution: number,   // Count of facilities with actual data
  facilitiesWithBoth: number         // Count of facilities with both
}
```

## Database Queries
The function performs efficient queries to retrieve metadata:

1. **Facility Level:** Single query to get facility details
2. **District Level:** Query facility with district relation
3. **Province Level:** Query facility with nested district and province relations

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 4.1: Include aggregationMetadata object in response
- ✅ 4.2: Include facility metadata for FACILITY level
- ✅ 4.3: Include district metadata for DISTRICT level
- ✅ 4.4: Include province metadata for PROVINCE level
- ✅ 4.5: Include totalFacilities count and facilitiesIncluded array
- ✅ 6.1: Validate facility has planning data
- ✅ 6.2: Validate facility has execution data

## Code Changes
1. **Added import:** `provinces` to the schema imports
2. **Created function:** `buildAggregationMetadata` with comprehensive metadata generation
3. **Data completeness analysis:** Implemented logic to analyze planning and execution data

## Next Steps
The function is now ready to be integrated into the statement generation handler (Task 5.3) where it will be called after data aggregation to include metadata in the response.

## Testing Notes
- Function uses existing database relations (facilities -> districts -> provinces)
- Handles cases where facilities, districts, or provinces might not be found
- Returns comprehensive metadata for all three aggregation levels
- Data completeness analysis works with Map-based aggregated data structures

## Status
✅ Task 3.1: Complete
✅ Task 3.2: Complete
✅ Task 3: Complete
