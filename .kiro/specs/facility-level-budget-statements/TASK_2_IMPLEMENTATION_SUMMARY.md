# Task 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented aggregation level determination logic for facility-level budget statements.

## Completed Subtasks

### 2.1 Create determineEffectiveFacilityIds utility function ✅
**Location:** `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts` (lines 1247-1297)

**Implementation Details:**
- Created async function that determines which facility IDs to include based on aggregation level
- Implements three aggregation levels:
  - **FACILITY**: Single facility mode with validation
  - **DISTRICT**: All accessible facilities in user's district (existing behavior)
  - **PROVINCE**: All accessible facilities in user's province
- Includes comprehensive access control validation
- Throws appropriate errors for invalid requests

**Key Features:**
1. **FACILITY Level Logic:**
   - Requires facilityId parameter
   - Validates user has access to requested facility
   - Returns single facility ID in array
   - Throws error if facilityId missing or access denied

2. **DISTRICT Level Logic:**
   - Uses existing behavior
   - Returns all facilities in user's accessibleFacilityIds
   - No additional validation needed

3. **PROVINCE Level Logic:**
   - Calls getProvinceFacilityIds helper
   - Returns all accessible facilities in user's province
   - Maintains access control through filtering

4. **Error Handling:**
   - "facilityId is required when aggregationLevel is FACILITY"
   - "Access denied to facility"
   - "Invalid aggregation level: {level}"

**Requirements Satisfied:** 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5

### 2.2 Create getProvinceFacilityIds helper function ✅
**Location:** `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts` (lines 1299-1343)

**Implementation Details:**
- Created async helper function to query province-level facilities
- Queries facilities table with district join to find all facilities in user's province
- Filters results by user's accessible facility IDs for access control
- Handles edge cases (no district, facility not found)

**Key Features:**
1. **Province Determination:**
   - Gets user's facility with district relationship
   - Extracts provinceId from district
   - Handles isolated facilities (no district)

2. **Facility Query:**
   - Joins facilities and districts tables
   - Filters by provinceId
   - Returns all facility IDs in province

3. **Access Control:**
   - Filters province facilities by user's accessibleFacilityIds
   - Ensures users only see facilities they have access to
   - Maintains security boundaries

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Returns only user's facility if no district
   - Returns only user's facility if facility/district not found
   - Graceful degradation to most restrictive access

**Requirements Satisfied:** 1.5

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Usage
- **facilities table:** id, districtId
- **districts table:** id, provinceId
- **Join:** facilities.districtId = districts.id

### Access Control
Both functions maintain strict access control by:
1. Validating facility access against user's accessibleFacilityIds
2. Filtering query results by accessible facilities
3. Throwing errors for unauthorized access attempts

### Type Safety
- Uses TypeScript for type safety
- Leverages UserContext interface from get-user-facility.ts
- Returns Promise<number[]> for async operations

## Integration Points

### Imports Added
```typescript
import { districts } from "@/api/db/schema";
import { type UserContext } from "@/lib/utils/get-user-facility";
```

### Dependencies
- Drizzle ORM for database queries
- UserContext interface for user information
- Database schema definitions (facilities, districts)

## Next Steps
These functions will be integrated into the statement generation handler in **Task 5: Update statement generation handler**.

The functions are currently unused (as expected) and will be called when:
1. Parsing new request parameters (aggregationLevel, facilityId)
2. Determining effectiveFacilityIds for data filters
3. Replacing current facility filtering logic

## Testing Considerations
When implementing tests (Task 8), verify:
1. FACILITY level with valid facilityId
2. FACILITY level without facilityId (should throw error)
3. FACILITY level with unauthorized facilityId (should throw error)
4. DISTRICT level (default behavior)
5. PROVINCE level with multiple districts
6. Edge cases: isolated facilities, missing districts

## Code Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Proper async/await usage
- ✅ Type safety with TypeScript
- ✅ Access control validation
- ✅ Edge case handling
- ✅ Requirements traceability in comments
