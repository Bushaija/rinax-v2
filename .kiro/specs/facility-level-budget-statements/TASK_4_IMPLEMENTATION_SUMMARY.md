# Task 4 Implementation Summary: Facility Breakdown Generator

## Overview
Successfully implemented the facility breakdown generator feature that provides detailed per-facility budget and actual amounts for aggregated statements (DISTRICT and PROVINCE levels).

## Implementation Details

### 4.1 Create generateFacilityBreakdown Function
**Location:** `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

Created a new function `generateFacilityBreakdown` that:
- Queries facility details for all effective facility IDs from the database
- Calculates budget amount per facility from planning data using `facilityTotals` map
- Calculates actual amount per facility from execution data using `facilityTotals` map
- Calculates variance (actual - budget) and variance percentage for each facility
- Determines favorability (negative variance is favorable for expenses)
- Sorts facilities by variance percentage in descending order (most unfavorable first)

**Key Features:**
- Uses efficient SQL query with IN clause to fetch all facility details at once
- Handles missing data gracefully (defaults to 0 if facility has no data)
- Rounds variance percentage to 2 decimal places for display
- Returns array of `FacilityBreakdownItem` objects

### 4.2 Add Conditional Breakdown Logic
**Location:** `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports/financial-reports.handlers.ts`

Integrated the facility breakdown into both Budget vs Actual and standard statement responses:

**Request Parameter Parsing:**
- Added `aggregationLevel` parameter (defaults to 'DISTRICT')
- Added `includeFacilityBreakdown` parameter (defaults to false)

**Conditional Logic:**
- Only generates breakdown when `includeFacilityBreakdown` is true
- Skips breakdown for FACILITY aggregation level (redundant)
- Includes breakdown for DISTRICT and PROVINCE levels
- Calls `buildAggregationMetadata` to provide context about the aggregation
- Calls `generateFacilityBreakdown` when conditions are met

**Response Integration:**
- Added `aggregationMetadata` field to response (provides aggregation context)
- Added `facilityBreakdown` field to response (contains per-facility details)
- Updated both Budget vs Actual and standard statement response paths

## Type Updates

### Updated FinancialStatementResponse Interface
**Location:** `apps/server/src/lib/statement-engine/types/core.types.ts`

Added two new optional fields:
```typescript
aggregationMetadata?: any; // Aggregation metadata for facility-level statements
facilityBreakdown?: any[]; // Optional facility breakdown for aggregated statements
```

## Data Structures

### FacilityBreakdownItem
Each item in the facility breakdown array contains:
- `facilityId`: Unique facility identifier
- `facilityName`: Facility name
- `facilityType`: Type of facility (e.g., Health Center, Hospital)
- `budget`: Total budget amount for the facility
- `actual`: Total actual expenditure for the facility
- `variance`: Difference between actual and budget (actual - budget)
- `variancePercentage`: Percentage variance ((variance / budget) * 100)
- `isFavorable`: Boolean indicating if variance is favorable (≤ 0 for expenses)

### AggregationMetadata
Provides context about the aggregation:
- `level`: Aggregation level (FACILITY, DISTRICT, or PROVINCE)
- `facilitiesIncluded`: Array of facility IDs included
- `totalFacilities`: Count of facilities
- `dataCompleteness`: Statistics about data availability
- Level-specific fields (facilityId/Name/Type, districtId/Name, provinceId/Name)

## Requirements Satisfied

### Task 4.1 Requirements (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5):
✅ Query facility details for all effective facility IDs
✅ Calculate budget amount per facility from planning data
✅ Calculate actual amount per facility from execution data
✅ Calculate variance and variance percentage per facility
✅ Determine favorability for each facility
✅ Sort facilities by variance percentage (descending)

### Task 4.2 Requirements (5.1, 5.2, 5.3):
✅ Only generate breakdown when includeFacilityBreakdown is true
✅ Skip breakdown for FACILITY aggregation level (redundant)
✅ Include breakdown for DISTRICT and PROVINCE levels

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Test `generateFacilityBreakdown` with multiple facilities
   - Test sorting by variance percentage
   - Test favorability calculation
   - Test with facilities having missing data (budget only, actual only, neither)

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Request district statement with `includeFacilityBreakdown=true`
   - Verify per-facility calculations are correct
   - Verify sorting order is correct
   - Verify breakdown is omitted for FACILITY level
   - Verify breakdown is omitted when `includeFacilityBreakdown=false`

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Facilities with zero budget (variance percentage calculation)
   - Facilities with no data (should show 0 for both budget and actual)
   - Single facility in district (should still work)
   - Large number of facilities (performance test)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All changes are backward compatible:
- New parameters are optional with sensible defaults
- Existing API clients will continue to work without changes
- Response structure is extended, not changed
- Default behavior (no breakdown) matches previous implementation

## Performance Considerations

- Single database query to fetch all facility details (efficient)
- Uses existing `facilityTotals` maps from aggregated data (no additional queries)
- Sorting is done in-memory on already aggregated data
- Breakdown generation is opt-in via request parameter

## Next Steps

The next task in the implementation plan is:
- **Task 5:** Update statement generation handler to integrate all new features
  - Parse new request parameters
  - Integrate aggregation level determination
  - Add aggregation metadata to response
  - Add facility breakdown to response
  - Maintain backward compatibility

However, much of Task 5 has already been completed as part of this implementation.
