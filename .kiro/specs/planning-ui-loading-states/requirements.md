# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The planning module currently lacks proper loading state feedback during critical user operations. When users create or update planning data, they are immediately redirected to the listing page, but the newly created/updated data doesn't appear until a manual page refresh. Additionally, during the save operation, users don't receive visual feedback about the progress of their action. The listing page also lacks skeleton loading states when initially fetching data, creating a jarring user experience.

This feature will implement comprehensive loading states throughout the planning workflow to provide better user feedback and improve the overall user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Save Operation Loading Feedback

**User Story:** As a user creating or updating planning data, I want to see visual feedback during the save operation, so that I know my action is being processed and can track its progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Save" button THEN the system SHALL display a loading toast with a progress indicator
2. WHEN the save operation is in progress THEN the toast SHALL show "Creating planning data..." or "Updating planning data..." based on the operation type
3. WHEN the save operation completes successfully THEN the loading toast SHALL be replaced with a success toast
4. WHEN the save operation fails THEN the loading toast SHALL be replaced with an error toast
5. WHEN the success toast appears THEN it SHALL display after the loading toast (not before)
6. WHEN the loading state is active THEN the save button SHALL be disabled to prevent duplicate submissions

### Requirement 2: Data Synchronization Before Redirect

**User Story:** As a user who just created planning data, I want to see my newly created data immediately in the listing page, so that I can confirm my action was successful without needing to refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning data is successfully created THEN the system SHALL invalidate the planning list cache
2. WHEN the cache is invalidated THEN the system SHALL wait for the refetch to complete before redirecting
3. WHEN the refetch completes THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the listing page
4. WHEN the user arrives at the listing page THEN the newly created/updated data SHALL be visible immediately
5. WHEN the synchronization is in progress THEN the loading toast SHALL remain visible
6. IF the refetch fails THEN the system SHALL still redirect but show a warning that data may need manual refresh

### Requirement 3: Listing Page Skeleton Loading

**User Story:** As a user navigating to the planning listing page, I want to see a skeleton loading state while data is being fetched, so that I understand the page is loading and have a preview of the content structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the planning listing page is loading THEN it SHALL display the DataTableSkeleton component
2. WHEN the skeleton is displayed THEN it SHALL match the column count of the actual planning table
3. WHEN the skeleton is displayed THEN it SHALL show a reasonable number of skeleton rows (e.g., 10)
4. WHEN data finishes loading THEN the skeleton SHALL be replaced with the actual data table
5. WHEN the page is in loading state THEN filter controls SHALL also show skeleton loaders
6. WHEN pagination is enabled THEN the skeleton SHALL include pagination skeleton elements

### Requirement 4: Consistent Loading States for Create and Update

**User Story:** As a user, I want the same loading experience whether I'm creating new planning data or updating existing data, so that the interface feels consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating planning data THEN the loading toast SHALL show "Creating planning data..."
2. WHEN updating planning data THEN the loading toast SHALL show "Updating planning data..."
3. WHEN either operation completes THEN the success toast SHALL use appropriate messaging ("created" vs "updated")
4. WHEN either operation is in progress THEN the same loading UI patterns SHALL be applied
5. WHEN either operation completes THEN the same data synchronization process SHALL occur before redirect

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user experiencing a save error, I want clear feedback about what went wrong and the ability to retry, so that I don't lose my work and can complete my task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a save operation fails THEN the loading toast SHALL be replaced with an error toast
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the user SHALL remain on the form page (no redirect)
3. WHEN an error toast is shown THEN it SHALL include a descriptive error message
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the save button SHALL be re-enabled to allow retry
5. WHEN a refetch fails after successful save THEN the system SHALL still redirect but log a warning
6. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the loading states to feel responsive and not block my workflow unnecessarily, so that I can work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the skeleton loader is displayed THEN it SHALL appear within 100ms of page navigation
2. WHEN data loads quickly (< 500ms) THEN the skeleton SHALL still be shown briefly to avoid flashing
3. WHEN the save operation completes THEN the redirect SHALL occur within 500ms of data synchronization
4. WHEN loading toasts are displayed THEN they SHALL not block user interaction with other parts of the interface
5. WHEN multiple operations occur in sequence THEN loading states SHALL transition smoothly without jarring UI changes
