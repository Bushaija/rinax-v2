# Execution Quarterly Data Cache Refresh Fix

## Problem

When reporting for a new quarter (e.g., Q3), the previously submitted quarter's data (e.g., Q2) doesn't appear until the page is manually reloaded.

### Example Scenario:
```
1. User submits Q2 data → Success ✅
2. User navigates to report Q3 → Q2 data missing ❌
3. User manually reloads page → Q2 data appears ✅
```

---

## Root Cause

The `useCheckExistingExecution` hook was using **React Query's default caching behavior**, which caches query results for 5 minutes (default `staleTime`). 

### The Flow:
```
1. User opens Q2 form
   ↓
2. useCheckExistingExecution checks for existing data
   ↓
3. Finds Q1 data, caches it
   ↓
4. User submits Q2 data
   ↓
5. User navigates to Q3 form
   ↓
6. useCheckExistingExecution uses CACHED data (still shows only Q1)
   ❌ Doesn't fetch fresh data with Q2
   ↓
7. User manually reloads
   ↓
8. Cache is cleared, fresh fetch shows Q1 + Q2 ✅
```

---

## Solution

Added cache invalidation configuration to `useCheckExistingExecution` to **always fetch fresh data** when checking for existing executions.

### Changes Made

**File**: `apps/client/hooks/queries/executions/use-check-existing-execution.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
function useCheckExistingExecution(query: CheckExistingExecutionRequest) {
  return useQuery<CheckExistingExecutionResponse>({
    queryFn: () => checkExistingExecution(query),
    queryKey: [
      "execution",
      "check-existing",
      query?.projectId ?? null,
      query?.facilityId ?? null,
      query?.reportingPeriodId ?? null,
    ],
    enabled: Boolean(
      query?.projectId && 
      query?.facilityId && 
      query?.reportingPeriodId
    ),
  });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
function useCheckExistingExecution(query: CheckExistingExecutionRequest) {
  return useQuery<CheckExistingExecutionResponse>({
    queryFn: () => checkExistingExecution(query),
    queryKey: [
      "execution",
      "check-existing",
      query?.projectId ?? null,
      query?.facilityId ?? null,
      query?.reportingPeriodId ?? null,
    ],
    enabled: Boolean(
      query?.projectId && 
      query?.facilityId && 
      query?.reportingPeriodId
    ),
    // Force fresh data on every mount to ensure latest quarterly data is loaded
    staleTime: 0,
    // Always refetch when component mounts to get the latest data
    refetchOnMount: 'always',
    // Refetch when window regains focus to catch updates from other tabs
    refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
  });
}
```

## Configuration Explained

### 1. `staleTime: 0`
- **Purpose**: Marks data as stale immediately
- **Effect**: Query will always refetch when needed
- **Why**: Ensures we never use outdated quarterly data

### 2. `refetchOnMount: 'always'`
- **Purpose**: Refetch every time the component mounts
- **Effect**: Fresh data on every navigation to the form
- **Why**: Catches updates from previous quarter submissions

### 3. `refetchOnWindowFocus: true`
- **Purpose**: Refetch when user returns to the tab
- **Effect**: Catches updates made in other tabs/windows
- **Why**: Multi-tab support for concurrent users

---

## How It Works Now

### New Flow:
```
1. User opens Q2 form
   ↓
2. useCheckExistingExecution fetches fresh data
   ↓
3. Finds Q1 data
   ↓
4. User submits Q2 data
   ↓
5. Smart submission invalidates cache
   ↓
6. User navigates to Q3 form
   ↓
7. useCheckExistingExecution REFETCHES (staleTime: 0)
   ✅ Gets fresh data with Q1 + Q2
   ↓
8. Q2 data appears immediately ✅
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Always Fresh Data**
- Every navigation fetches the latest quarterly data
- No stale cache issues
- Users see their previous submissions immediately

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- No need to manually reload
- Seamless workflow between quarters
- Predictable behavior

### 3. **Multi-Tab Support**
- Updates in one tab are visible in others
- Window focus triggers refresh
- Prevents data conflicts

### 4. **Reliable Quarterly Workflow**
- Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4 flow works smoothly
- Each quarter sees all previous quarters
- No missing data issues

## Performance Considerations

### Potential Concern:
"Won't this cause too many API calls?"

### Answer:
**No, it's actually optimal for this use case:**

1. **Infrequent Navigation**: Users don't rapidly switch between quarters
2. **Small Payload**: Check endpoint is lightweight
3. **Critical Data**: Fresh quarterly data is essential for accuracy
4. **User Expectation**: Users expect to see their just-submitted data

### Trade-off:
- **Before**: Fewer API calls, but stale data and manual reloads
- **After**: More API calls, but always fresh data and better UX

**The trade-off is worth it** for data accuracy and user experience.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. **Manual Cache Invalidation**
```typescript
// In submission handler
queryClient.invalidateQueries(['execution', 'check-existing']);
```
**Problem**: Already implemented in smart submission, but doesn't help when navigating from a different session or tab.

### 2. **Longer Stale Time with Selective Invalidation**
```typescript
staleTime: 60000, // 1 minute
```
**Problem**: Still has a window where stale data can appear.

### 3. **Optimistic Updates**
```typescript
queryClient.setQueryData(['execution', 'check-existing'], newData);
```
**Problem**: Complex to implement, error-prone, doesn't handle multi-tab scenarios.

### 4. **Polling**
```typescript
refetchInterval: 5000, // Poll every 5 seconds
```
**Problem**: Wasteful, unnecessary API calls when user isn't actively working.

**Chosen Solution** (`staleTime: 0` + `refetchOnMount: 'always'`) is the simplest and most reliable.

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Sequential Quarter Submission
```
1. Submit Q1 data
2. Navigate to Q2 form
3. Verify Q1 data is visible ✅
4. Submit Q2 data
5. Navigate to Q3 form
6. Verify Q1 + Q2 data is visible ✅
7. Submit Q3 data
8. Navigate to Q4 form
9. Verify Q1 + Q2 + Q3 data is visible ✅
```

### Test Case 2: Non-Sequential Quarter Submission
```
1. Submit Q1 data
2. Navigate to Q3 form (skip Q2)
3. Verify Q1 data is visible ✅
4. Submit Q3 data
5. Navigate to Q2 form
6. Verify Q1 + Q3 data is visible ✅
```

### Test Case 3: Multi-Tab Scenario
```
1. Open Q2 form in Tab A
2. Open Q2 form in Tab B
3. Submit Q2 data in Tab A
4. Switch to Tab B
5. Verify Q2 data appears (refetchOnWindowFocus) ✅
```

### Test Case 4: Network Throttling
```
1. Enable slow 3G in DevTools
2. Navigate to Q2 form
3. Verify loading state shows
4. Verify data loads correctly
5. No timeout errors ✅
```

### Smart Submission Cache Invalidation
The smart submission already invalidates the cache after successful submission:

```typescript
// From use-smart-execution-submission.ts
onSuccess: (result, variables) => {
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({
    queryKey: ["execution", "check-existing", 
      variables.projectId, 
      variables.facilityId, 
      variables.reportingPeriodId
    ]
  });
}
```

**This works together with our fix:**
- Submission invalidates cache
- Next navigation refetches fresh data
- User sees updated quarterly data immediately

## Summary

### Problem:
❌ Q2 data doesn't appear when navigating to Q3 form

### Root Cause:
❌ React Query cached stale data

### Solution:
✅ Force fresh data fetch on every mount

### Result:
✅ Users always see the latest quarterly data
✅ No manual reloads needed
✅ Smooth quarterly workflow
✅ Multi-tab support
