## UI Components Used

All pages now use:
- `Button` component from `@/components/ui/button`
- `ArrowLeft` icon from `lucide-react` for back navigation
- `Edit` icon from `lucide-react` for quick edit action (details page only)

## Navigation Flow

```
Listing Page (/dashboard/planning)
    ↓
    ├─→ New Page (/dashboard/planning/new)
    │       ↓ [Back Button]
    │       └─→ Listing Page
    │
    ├─→ Edit Page (/dashboard/planning/edit/[id])
    │       ↓ [Back Button]
    │       └─→ Listing Page
    │
    └─→ Details Page (/dashboard/planning/details/[id])
            ↓ [Back Button]
            ├─→ Listing Page
            │
            ↓ [Quick Edit Button]
            └─→ Edit Page (/dashboard/planning/edit/[id])
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Navigation**: Users can easily return to the listing page from any sub-page
2. **Quick Actions**: Details page includes quick edit button for faster workflow
3. **Consistent UX**: All pages follow the same header pattern with title, description, and actions
4. **Clear Context**: Page titles and descriptions help users understand their current location
5. **Better Accessibility**: Proper button labels and icons improve usability

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigation Testing**:
   - Click back button on new page → should return to listing
   - Click back button on edit page → should return to listing
   - Click back button on details page → should return to listing
   - Click quick edit button on details page → should navigate to edit page

2. **Visual Testing**:
   - Verify header alignment and spacing
   - Check button styling and hover states
   - Ensure icons display correctly
   - Verify responsive behavior on mobile

3. **Workflow Testing**:
   - Create new planning → verify back button works
   - Edit existing planning → verify back button works
   - View details → verify both back and quick edit buttons work
   - Quick edit from details → verify navigation to edit page with correct ID
