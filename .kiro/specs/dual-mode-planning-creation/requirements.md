# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing planning creation workflow by introducing a dual-mode interface that allows users to either enter planning data manually (existing functionality) or upload Excel/CSV files for bulk import. The enhancement will be implemented on the Next.js `/planning/new` page with a tabbed interface, leveraging the existing `/planning/upload` API endpoint.

## Glossary

- **Planning_System**: The financial planning module that manages budget planning data for healthcare facilities
- **Manual_Entry_Mode**: The existing workflow where users input planning data through form fields
- **File_Upload_Mode**: The new workflow where users upload Excel/CSV files containing planning data
- **Tab_Interface**: A user interface component with two tabs for switching between entry modes
- **Upload_API**: The existing `/planning/upload` endpoint that processes file uploads
- **Planning_Form**: The enhanced form component that supports both manual and file upload modes
- **File_Parser**: The backend service that processes uploaded Excel/CSV files
- **Validation_Service**: The backend service that validates planning data against schema rules

5. IF an invalid file format is selected, THEN THE Planning_System SHALL display an error message specifying accepted formats

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a facility accountant, I want to download a template file for my facility and program type, so that I can ensure my upload data matches the expected format.

#### Acceptance Criteria
