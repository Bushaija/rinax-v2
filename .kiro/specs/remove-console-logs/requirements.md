# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing API endpoint performance by removing unnecessary console.log statements from the planning, execution, and financial-reports modules. Excessive logging has been identified as a performance bottleneck that slows down API responses.

## Glossary

- **Console Logs**: JavaScript console.log() statements used for debugging that output to the server console
- **Planning Module**: The API route handler for planning-related operations located at `apps/server/src/api/routes/planning`
- **Execution Module**: The API route handler for execution-related operations located at `apps/server/src/api/routes/execution`
- **Financial Reports Module**: The API route handler for financial report operations located at `apps/server/src/api/routes/financial-reports`
- **Handler Files**: TypeScript files containing route handler logic (*.handlers.ts)
- **Helper Files**: TypeScript files containing utility functions (*.helpers.ts, *.recalculations.ts)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to remove unnecessary console logs from the planning module, so that API response times are improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Planning Module handler files are processed, THE System SHALL remove all console.log statements from planning.handlers.ts
2. THE System SHALL preserve the functional logic of all route handlers in the Planning Module
3. THE System SHALL maintain code readability after log removal in the Planning Module

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to remove unnecessary console logs from the execution module, so that API response times are improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Execution Module handler files are processed, THE System SHALL remove all console.log statements from execution.handlers.ts
2. WHEN the Execution Module helper files are processed, THE System SHALL remove all console.log statements from execution.recalculations.ts
3. THE System SHALL preserve the functional logic of all route handlers in the Execution Module
4. THE System SHALL maintain code readability after log removal in the Execution Module

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to remove unnecessary console logs from the financial-reports module, so that API response times are improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Financial Reports Module handler files are processed, THE System SHALL remove all console.log statements from financial-reports.handlers.ts
2. THE System SHALL preserve the functional logic of all route handlers in the Financial Reports Module
3. THE System SHALL maintain code readability after log removal in the Financial Reports Module
4. THE System SHALL remove console.log statements that span multiple lines in the Financial Reports Module

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to verify that log removal does not break existing functionality, so that the application continues to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console logs are removed from any module, THE System SHALL verify that no syntax errors are introduced
2. THE System SHALL ensure that all TypeScript files compile successfully after log removal
3. THE System SHALL preserve all business logic and computational functions
