# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The validation service is failing when processing planning data for HIV programs due to a TypeError where `validationRules is not iterable`. This occurs in the `applyCustomValidations` method when the `validationRules` property is not properly formatted as an array, causing the application to crash with a 500 Internal Server Error. This fix will ensure the validation service handles various data formats gracefully and provides meaningful error messages instead of crashing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating planning data for any program type, I want the validation service to handle malformed validation rules gracefully, so that I receive clear error messages instead of application crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation rules are not in array format THEN the system SHALL treat them as an empty array and continue processing
2. WHEN validation rules contain invalid data types THEN the system SHALL log the issue and skip invalid rules
3. WHEN validation processing encounters any error THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message instead of crashing
4. WHEN validation rules are undefined or null THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully without throwing errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging validation issues, I want comprehensive error logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve validation rule configuration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation rules are malformed THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the field and rule structure
2. WHEN custom validation formulas fail THEN the system SHALL log the formula, context, and error details
3. WHEN validation processing encounters unexpected data types THEN the system SHALL log the actual data type and expected format
4. IF logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL include request context and field information in validation error logs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the validation service to be resilient to data inconsistencies, so that the application remains stable even with corrupted or malformed schema data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema fields contain unexpected properties THEN the system SHALL ignore unknown properties and process valid ones
2. WHEN validation rules reference non-existent fields THEN the system SHALL skip those rules and continue validation
3. WHEN the validation service encounters any runtime error THEN the system SHALL return a structured error response instead of throwing exceptions
4. WHEN processing large datasets with mixed validation rule formats THEN the system SHALL maintain performance and stability
