# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical data consistency issue in the execution data retrieval system where the stored activity data doesn't match the context used for UI generation. Currently, when retrieving execution records, the system uses form data context (which may be incorrect or outdated) to determine which activity catalog to load for UI display, resulting in mismatched data where Malaria activities are displayed with HIV context and vice versa.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want execution data retrieval to use consistent project and facility type information, so that the correct activity catalog is loaded and displayed in the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving execution data THEN the system SHALL use the actual project and facility information from the database rather than potentially incorrect form data context
2. WHEN form data context differs from database records THEN the system SHALL prioritize database records for determining activity catalog
3. WHEN building UI response THEN the system SHALL ensure activity codes match the project and facility type being used

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing execution details, I want to see activities that match the actual project and facility type of the record, so that the data displayed is accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing execution record 31 (Malaria, Health Center) THEN the system SHALL display MAL_EXEC_HEALTH_CENTER activities
2. WHEN the UI context shows project type and facility type THEN these SHALL match the actual database record values
3. WHEN activities are displayed THEN all activity codes SHALL be consistent with the record's actual project and facility type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle context mismatches gracefully, so that data integrity is maintained even when form data contains incorrect context information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form data context is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to database record information
2. WHEN form data context conflicts with database records THEN the system SHALL log a warning and use database values
3. WHEN context correction occurs THEN the system SHALL update the UI context to reflect the correct values
