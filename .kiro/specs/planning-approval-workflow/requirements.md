# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Planning Approval Workflow feature enables a structured approval process for plans created by planners/accountants. The system ensures that only verified and approved plans can proceed to execution phases such as budgeting, disbursement, or activity tracking. The workflow implements role-based access control with clear status transitions and audit trails.

## Glossary

- **Planning System**: The software system that manages plan creation, approval, and execution
- **Plan**: A structured document or data entry containing planning information that requires approval
- **Planner**: A user role (Accountant/Planner) authorized to create and upload plans
- **Admin**: A user role (Admin/Reviewer) authorized to review, approve, or reject plans
- **Approval Status**: The current state of a plan in the approval workflow (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED)
- **Execution Phase**: Any system process that uses approved plans (budgeting, disbursement, activity tracking)
