# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the execution listing API to include district information in the response object and enable district-based filtering for admin users. Currently, the execution listing response includes filters for facilityType, projectType, reportingPeriod, and quarter, but lacks district information which is essential for admin users who need to filter executions by district.

## Glossary

- **Execution_API**: The REST API endpoint `/execution` that returns a list of execution data entries
- **Admin_User**: A user with administrative privileges who can access execution data across multiple districts
- **District_Filter**: A query parameter that allows filtering execution data by district identifier
- **Response_Object**: The JSON response structure returned by the execution listing API
- **Execution_Entry**: A single execution data record in the system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see district information in the execution listing response, so that I can identify which district each execution belongs to

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user requests the execution list, THE Execution_API SHALL include district information in each execution entry
2. THE Execution_API SHALL include districtId and districtName fields in the response data structure
3. THE Execution_API SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing response structure
4. THE Execution_API SHALL only include district information when the requesting user has admin privileges
5. WHERE the user is not an admin, THE Execution_API SHALL exclude district information from the response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to filter executions by district, so that I can view execution data for specific districts

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user provides a district filter parameter, THE Execution_API SHALL return only executions from the specified district
2. THE Execution_API SHALL accept a districtId query parameter for filtering
3. THE Execution_API SHALL validate that the provided districtId exists in the system
4. IF an invalid districtId is provided, THEN THE Execution_API SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHERE no district filter is provided, THE Execution_API SHALL return executions from all accessible districts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the district filter to be included in the response filters object, so that I can see which district filter was applied

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a district filter is applied, THE Execution_API SHALL include the district filter in the response filters object
2. THE Execution_API SHALL include districtId in the filters section of the response
3. THE Execution_API SHALL maintain consistency with existing filter response structure
4. WHERE no district filter is applied, THE Execution_API SHALL omit the district filter from the response filters object

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a non-admin user, I want the district filtering to be restricted, so that I can only access executions from my assigned district

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-admin user attempts to use district filtering, THE Execution_API SHALL ignore the district filter parameter
2. THE Execution_API SHALL apply existing facility-based access control for non-admin users
3. THE Execution_API SHALL not expose district information to non-admin users in the response
4. THE Execution_API SHALL maintain existing security boundaries for non-admin users
